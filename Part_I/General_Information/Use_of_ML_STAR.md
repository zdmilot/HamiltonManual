# Use of the ML STAR

The ML STAR is a robotic pipetting workstation used for pipetting liquid samples in an automated process suitable for medium to high throughput with a high degree of flexibility in pharmaceutical, veterinary, genomics, proteomics, cellomics, and other related fields.

The ML STAR is classified as a general laboratory instrument and is not an _in vitro_ diagnostic device.
