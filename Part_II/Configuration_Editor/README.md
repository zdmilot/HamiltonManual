# Hamilton System Configuration Editor

The ML STAR is available in several configurations. Use the Hamilton System Configuration Editor to configure the VENUS Software to a specific instrument configuration. The primary configuration will be done by the Hamilton Trained Field Service Engineer during the instrument installation.

The simulator runs with the same configuration as the instrument. If the VENUS Software is installed on a PC without a connected instrument, it is possible to configure the simulator manually to the instrument configuration, for which the method is intended to be written. Some configuration options are not instrument-dependent and have to be edited in any case.

To open the “Hamilton System Configuration Editor”, start the “Method Editor” and click from the “Tools -> System Configuration Editor” Menu.

Or double-click the “Hamilton.HxConfigEditor.exe” in the directory “HAMILTON\bin”. The “Hamilton System Configuration Editor” opens as shown in the image below.

When the “Hamilton System Configuration Editor” has been activated, the first decision to be made – prior to the run – is whether to run the method with a real instrument or to simulate the run without using the instrument. Run simulation is a tool for testing whether a method has been programmed correctly. The run simulator creates a method trace file with pipetting pattern and other useful information.
