# Method Editor Details

Methods are programs that string together a number of specified commands (such as aspirate or dispense) to instruct the instrument to perform a function. They can be as complex as or as simple as the programmer desires. Access to a method editor is necessary to define or edit methods.

## Action Editor

The action editor view is a very simplified way to program methods. In the toolbox of the action editor, all possible actions on an instrument can be found. “Drag and Drop” of an action will invoke a wizard to get all necessary information from the user. At the end, a graphic view of a method is shown.

## Graphical Method Editor

The graphical method editor (called method editor) is a syntax-free editor that presents a group-like graphical editing environment. Common constructions such as loops, conditionals and built-in functions are supported by this editor. It also provides a variable management system. This system simplifies variable usage by allowing implicit declarations and by supplying complete variable context to edit dialogs.

The output of the method editor is a linked set of files that may be executed by the _Run Control_. In most cases (but not necessarily), a method refers to one single deck layout.

1.  #### ‌Views and Windows‌

    The method editor is divided into multiple attachable windows (these are empty during start-up):

    These windows can be activated by selecting the “View” Menu:\

2.  #### ‌Toolbars‌

    The toolbars contains some of the most frequently used commands to be executed directly by a mouse click. The toolbar can be docked or detached by a drag and drop.

    The “Tool Bar” Icons are shown on the left of the corresponding menu functions.
