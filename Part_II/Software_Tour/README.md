# ML VENUS Software Tour

VENUS Software allows programming the ML STAR instrument according to the needs of the workflow and assay. Like any other software by Hamilton, Hamilton-specific terms are used. Some terms are explained in short summaries to make the programming easier.&#x20;

The second part of this section shows an example on how to create programs.&#x20;

The master editor called the “Method Editor” combines several sub-editors, which helps optimize the workflow and pipetting results. There are two ways of displaying a method.&#x20;

First option is to use the step oriented method editor. Here, the method is created by adding steps from the toolbox to the step oriented “Method Editor”.&#x20;

The second option is through the “Action Editor”. The Action Editor offers a more visual representation of the method.&#x20;

The selected actions in the toolbox can be dragged and dropped to the editor window. Arrows show the chronological order of the process.&#x20;

Both editors are using the same set of data. The editors, however, use different ways to display data.&#x20;

To switch between both views, use the following icons:&#x20;
