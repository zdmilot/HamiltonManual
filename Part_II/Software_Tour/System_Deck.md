# System Deck

The System Deck Editor window can display two different views of the instrument.

The system view (available by pressing the System Tab in the lower left of the window) shows the instrument from the outside including all surrounding instruments such as 3rd party components etc. The programmer is able to design the real environment in the software by adding instruments (e.g. ML STAR pipetting workstation, rack runner plate handling robot, etc.) and other devices (e.g. readers, washers, incubators, plate hotels, etc.) onto the system deck.

Each added instrument will be represented by its specific instrument tab.

The STAR instrument is represented by a deck. A deck layout is a graphical illustration of the work surface of a pipetting robot. It contains all the information about the carriers and labware being used as well as the x/y/z coordinates of the positions.
