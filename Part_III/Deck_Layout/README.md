# How to Create a Deck Layout

In the deck layout section of the method editor, the programmer declares what labware (carriers, racks or containers) is used in the procedure and where these items are positioned on the deck. This action is called “Defining a Deck Layout”.

Creating a new method will also create a deck layout with the same name as the method.

The easiest way to have a new deck layout is to create a new method. This will automatically create a new deck with the same name.

To access the newly created deck, simply click on the System Deck Icon:

System Deck

It is possible to create a deck layout without creating a new method. To do this, select “File  New

 System Deck” in the Method Editor.

* “Open existing system or instrument layout”, to base the deck layout on an existing layout or on a template.
* “Use template to create a new system” with an instrument-specific definition of dimensions, main grid and hidden grids, with pre-loaded standard labware such as a waste container. Deck templates can be customized.
* “Use instrument to create a new system”, to base a layout on the layout of the connected instrument. This is the most common way to start.
* “Create an empty bench” to start creating a layout with an empty deck.

\


Once a choice have been made and possibly browsed for an existing template or layout, the menu bar now includes the “System Deck” Menu and the “System Deck” Window will be displayed. The Deck Layout shows the tracks of the predefined grids from the appropriate deck template.

Use the tabs in the left lower corner of the window, highlighted above, to switch between the system view (full instrument and third party components) and the instrument tab (here: ML\_STAR) to see the instrument deck.

The functional panel found on the top right corner of the window can be used to see the layer selection, the (labware) preview or the stamp tool selection:

The functions in the Zoom toolbar help in finding the right view.
