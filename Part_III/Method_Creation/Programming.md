# Programming

Dragging icons from the toolbox on the left and dropping them into the method window on the right will easily write a method.

Inserting a new command or performing a double click on an existing command opens the corresponding dialog to edit the command-specific parameters. For example, using the “Assignment” Command, which is used to define and assign variables. A dialog box which allows values specification will prompt, as shown in the image below.

Copy - Paste Step

The familiar copy-paste technique can also be used. To apply, simply highlight the step or the block of adjacent steps.

On the “Edit” Menu, click “Copy” or click \[Ctrl]-key and perform a left-click “Drag and Drop”.

To insert a step from the buffer, click on the line above where the step should be inserted, then paste.

It is also possible to load different methods into the editor and copy steps between methods.

Enable/Disable Step

All steps can be disabled/enabled upon request. Perform a right click on a step or a selected block of steps and selecting “disable / enable” from the Context Menu.

Disabled Steps change their color:

| <p>Enabled: white background shows that the step</p><p>will be executed at runtime.</p> | <p>Disabled: dark background indicates that the</p><p>step is not executed during run.</p> |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

Group Steps

1. To have a structure in the method, it is possible to combine several steps into one group. To do so, select the desired steps and right-click to enter the Context Menu.
2.  Select “Group Selection”.

Saving Methods

Once at least one change in a method has been made and an exit from the method editor is wanted, a prompt will ask whether to save the changes or not.

At any time, the work can be saved by selecting "File – Save" or simply through the toolbar icon “![image](../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_433.gif)” for Save and “![image](../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_434.gif)”for Save All.
