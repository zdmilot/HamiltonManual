# Stamp Tool

The “Stamp Tool[” Function allows applying the sequence positions to a labware depending on the pipetting tool being used: 1 to 16-Pipetting Channels, CO-RE 96 Probe Head, CO-RE 384 Probe Head, CO-RE 384 Probe Head STP (see ](Stamp\_Tool.md#bookmark369)[Section 12.8 Method using the CO-RE 384 Probe ](Stamp\_Tool.md#bookmark369)Head) and Nano Pipettor. The order is applied during the adding of labware onto the deck or when using the rubber band function to create new sequences.

The “Single position” Selection adds 1 position to the new sequence wherever the cursor is positioned and ticked (on a container).
