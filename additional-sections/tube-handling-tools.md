# Tube Handling Tools‌

### _Tube-gripper‌_

\


![tubeGripper](../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1582.jpg)

_This section provides all necessary information about the tube-gripper. This tool can be used to move tubes to a barcode reader (if the Autoload option is not installed), to load/unload tubes to an integrated centrifuge, to pick specific tubes from multiple carriers into one target carrier, to move tubes to a balance (measuring evaporation), etc._

_This tool is mounted on a pipetting channel and can be moved over the deck in the same way as the pipetting channels._

1.  #### _‌Using the Tube-gripper Steps‌_

    \


    _First, make sure that the tube-gripper is activated in the Hamilton System Configuration Editor. Set both the tube-gripper and the Autoload option line to ‘Available’ as shown below:_

    _In the Method Editor, the tube-gripper steps are found:_

    _“Tube Grip Get”_

    _This step is used to pick a tube. The parameters to pass are the following:_

    * _Sequence (where to get the tube)_
    * _Sequence counting (manually, to leave the current position untouched)_
    * _Grip height in mm, measured from the top of the tube_
    *   _Opening width before access in mm (maximum = 24mm)_

        _“Tube Grip Place”_

        _This step is used to place a gripped tube. The parameters to pass are the following:_
    * _Sequence (where to put the tube)_
    * _Sequence counting (manually, to leave the current position untouched)_
    *   _Relative clamp open width in mm._

        _NOTE_

        _The relative clamp open width is a relative value. If the gripped tube requires a clamp position of 20mm, there is only 4mm left to open (because 24mm is the maximum opening width)._

        \


        _“Tube Grip Move”_

        _This step is used to move a gripped tube to a specific position without opening the clamp. This could be used e.g. to move the tube in front of an external barcode reader._

        _The parameter to pass is the:_
    *   _Sequence (where to move \[and hold] the tube)._

        _Keep in mind that the step will move the tube to the current position of the sequence that has been passed._

        _“Tube Grip Read Barcode”_

        _This step is used to move a gripped tube to a specific position without opening the clamp. This step will grip a tube and bring it to the Autoload barcode reader for reading._

        _The parameter to pass is the:_
    * _Reader position \[track number]_

    _This value specifies the track, where the Autoload barcode reader will move to. After the movement to this position, the tube-gripper will bring the tube in front of the reader and read the barcode._

    _In order to link the value of the barcode to a variable, the return value of the step has to be linked._

    1.  _To do so, right-click the Tube Grip Read Barcode in the method and select ‘Bind Return values’:_

        \

    2.  _A window opens to link the different return values to variables. The value from line 4 (which is the barcode) will be used in the example as seen in the image below._

        \

    3. _Type in or select a variable that will hold the value of the barcode. Finish with \[OK]._

    _NOTE_

    _The tube-gripper is able to grip tubes with an outer diameter of 8 to 22mm._

    _The tube-gripper clamps need additional space when gripping tubes with large diameter (15 – 22mm). In an event like this, leave a space on the left and right of the tube carrier._
