# Wash Station 96/384‌



_The Wash Station 96/384 is an optional device for washing 96/384 disposable tips in parallel. The tips are washed both outside and inside at the same time: on the outside in the wash chambers of the wash station and on the inside by aspiration/dispense cycles using the CO-RE 96 Probe Head / TADM or the CO-RE 384 Probe Head. The result of washing the tips depends on the wash setting._

_NOTE_

_If carry-over is not acceptable for the application, use new disposable tips for each aspiration step._

\


_Sample transfers can be done using new disposable tips, while reagents, buffers, etc. can be distributed with washed tips._

    _ATTENTION_

    _The CO-RE 384 Probe Head performs a blow out after the wash steps. The software automatically uses the tip picking up position (tip rack). Therefore do not reload the tip rack of the pick-up position if performing any wash steps._
2.  ### _‌Programming the Wash Station 96/384‌_

    \


    _The following is a simple example on how to program the wash station 96/384 using the Single Steps._

    _Activate the CO-RE 384 Probe Head and the Pump Station 2 in the Configuration Editor:_

    \

    \


    _Creating the Deck Layout_

    _The method requires the following Deck Layout:_

    \


    ![image](../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1673.jpg)

    \


    _Use the “Search Labware” Field to add the following labware to the deck:_

    * _“CORE384DualWashStation\_HU\_A00”_
    * _“Core 384 Slide Waste”_
    * _“TIP384\_CAR\_1920\_50ul\_A00”_

    \


    _Creating the Sequences_

    _In this example, the default sequences are being used._

    _Creating the Method_

    _The resulting method should look like the image below:_

    \

    _The step in line 1 initializes the instrument._

    _In step 2, the tips are picked up from the tip carrier (sequence counting = “Manually”)._

    \

    \


    1.  _Use the “CO-RE 384 Head Wash” Wash Step without modifying the default values. These values guarantee and are the basis for good wash results._

        \


        ![image](../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1676.jpg)
    2. _Eject the tips. Use “Eject on tip pick up position” to eject the tips back into the tip carrier._
