1. Select "Tools -> Hamilton Support Software..." from the menu bar.
2.  Select "Modify" on the welcome screen, then \[Next >].

3. Click on a “![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png>)” sign to open a branch and mark / unmark the required components by ticking the boxes.
4. Click \[Next >] to install the selected items.
