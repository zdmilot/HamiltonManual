# Barcode Settings

The “Barcode settings” allows:

* Selection of a plate to assign the barcode to if multiple plates are on the same carrier position
* Enabling or disabling of the generation of a barcode trace file (C:\Program Files\HAMILTON\LogFiles\barcodes\_N.txt)
* Selection of the barcode types which are allowed on the instrument

The storage location of the barcode is dependent on the operating system and the language settings.
