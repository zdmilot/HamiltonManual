# Labware

The software comes with a set of definitions for the standard labware items that are most commonly used in laboratories. The carrier name and definition selected must always be identical to the name with which the physical carrier is labeled.

A carrier feature is a varying number of locations for the placement of labware, such as tip racks, microplates, etc.

For the standard carriers and their names, refer directly to the software list which is shown through an image in the next page. The list box displays the available labware names. The selected piece of labware is defined briefly on the right-hand side of the window with its corresponding picture.

The benefits of a plate carrier to the left of Track 1 are:

* Higher deck density, lower reloads
* Work positions available for Multi-Probe Heads
* Labware storage positions available for iSWAP / CO-RE Grips

Definition

A labware item describes the geometry of objects which can be dealt with as a whole, such as the wells of a microplate, or which can be combined on the deck, such as a carrier holding several plates.

The ML STAR can be used with all kind of labware such as tubes, microplates, reagent troughs, etc. VENUS Software comes with a set of standard labware definitions.

Pre-loaded Tips and Tube Carriers

In addition to plate and tip carriers, sample carriers can also be placed on the deck. These carriers are pre-loaded with tubes of a specified size (diameter and length). In fact, these carriers are racks (_.rck) in contrast to the other carriers, which are carrier templates (_.tml). The tube carriers are examples of racks which fit directly into the track grids of the ML STAR.

There are also pre-loaded racks and carriers available, for example, a tip carrier equipped with standard tips (TIP\_CAR\_480\_ST\_A00) and more.
