## Containers

Containers are vessels which hold liquids. They are usually placed in racks. They can also be placed directly onto the carriers, which is the case with reagent containers. An example for containers would be the tubes or the wells of a Microplate.

## Rectangular Racks and Plates

Rectangular racks are specialized grids for holding containers (or tips) in row and column order. A Microplate is a rack in this circumstance and the wells represent as containers. The rack is therefore a template describing a discrete number of positions for holding containers (or tips).&#x20;

Examples of racks include a tube rack, a Microplate, a microtiter strip, a deep-well plate, and a tip rack.&#x20;

The filename has the extension “.rck”.&#x20;



## Circular Racks&#x20;

Circular racks are specialized grids for holding containers in a segment of a circle.&#x20;

The filename has the extension “.crk”.
