# Labware Categories

_To be able to group the labware in the selection tree of the System Deck Editor, each labware has to be assigned to a labware category first. For the labware that comes with the default installation, this has been done already._

_However, in creating an own new labware, connection should be done manually._

1. _Open the Labware Editor where the rack or template has been created._
2.  _Choose the category where the rack or template will be linked to and click \[Assigned Category]._

3. _The category is displayed in the “Assigned Labware Category” Field shown in the image above. Assigning a labware for more than one category can be done. For instance, a 96-well Deep Well Plate can be in the category “Plates  96 Position Plates” and in the “Deep Well Plates” Category._
4.  _In order to apply the changes into the software, update the labware category index. Select “Generate Labware Category Index” in the Labware Editor, as shown below._
