# ‌Linking a Deck to a Method‌

If an existing system deck will be used for a method that will be newly programmed, it has to be linked to the new method.

To link the deck layout to the new method, simply follow these steps:

1.  Click the "Method -> Instruments and Smart Steps..." Menu. The “Instruments” Dialog will appear.

2. Click \[Browse], to browse for the System Deck. A file selection dialog appears.
3. Click in the file dialog to select a deck layout and click \[OK]. The “System Deck File:” and “Instruments:” fields in the dialog show the selected file and instrument.
4.  Click the checkboxes under “Smart Steps:”, to select “ML STAR Smart Steps”, “Data Handling Steps”, or “Custom Dialog Steps” (they can also be enabled and disabled later by activating the dialog again). Depending on the selection, more toolbars are added to the toolbox which can be found on the left side of the Editor’s Window.

5. As soon as the method uses instrument-specific steps, the “ML STAR” Option in the “Instrument” Section of the “Instruments” Dialog (see image shown above), is locked and can no longer be disabled. The system deck can no longer be separated from the method until all instrument-specific steps are deleted again. The same applies to the options in the Smart Steps Section.\
