# Liquid Handling (Pipetting)‌

This section describes the process of pipetting liquids using the ML STAR instruments.

Definition

Pipetting means the transfer of (small or large) quantities of liquid from one container to another. A pipetting operation is achieved through the following:

* Tip or needle pickup
* Aspirating liquid from a source container
* Dispensing it into a target container
* Tip or needle eject

The ML STAR is based on the air displacement pipetting principle, comparable to the work principle of handheld pipettes.

Air displacement means that the liquid is aspirated into and dispensed from a disposable tip or needle by the movement of a plunger. There is air between the plunger and the liquid surface. No system liquid of any kind is involved in the ML STAR. On the ML STAR, the pipetting of volumes from 0.5µl up to 5ml are processed. Filter tips can be used to avoid contamination by aerosol.

### Avoiding Contamination‌

If cross-contamination is a concern, consider the following approaches:

* Use only Hamilton tips on the ML STAR.
* Use new tips for every pipetting step, to avoid carry-over between different wells or containers.
* Use filter tips in order to avoid contamination of the pipetting channel by jets, aerosols, etc.
* Dispense any compounds at risk for cross-contamination onto a surface. Dispensing in a jet may produce aerosols and thus can cause cross-contamination.

Dispense using a residual volume, i.e. do not completely empty the tip on dispense. This can be achieved e.g. by aspirating 11µl and dispensing only 10µl.
