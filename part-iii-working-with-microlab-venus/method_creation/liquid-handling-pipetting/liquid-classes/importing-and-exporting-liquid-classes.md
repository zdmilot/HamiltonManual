# ‌Importing and Exporting Liquid Classes‌

_Liquid classes are stored in a database file. Opening the liquid editor loads liquids defined in the standard liquid database file (...\Hamilton\Config\ML\_STARLiquids.mdb). If other liquids are needed from another liquid configuration file, they can be imported._\


## To Import a Liquid:

1.  _Click “File -> Import Liquid Classes...” in the liquid editor start window:_
