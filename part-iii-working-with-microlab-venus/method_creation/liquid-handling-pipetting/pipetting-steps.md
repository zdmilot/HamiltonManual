2.  #### _‌Easy Steps‌_

    \


    _There are two Easy Steps for the pipetting channels, the CO-RE 96 Probe Head and the CO-RE 384 Probe Head:_

    * _Aspirate (including the pickup of disposable tips/needles)._
    * _Dispense (including the disposable tips/needles wash and eject)._

    _The Easy Steps are installed by default. These commands can be found in the “ML\_STAR” Toolbox Group._

3.  #### _‌Single Steps‌_

    \


    _If highest flexibility of the system is required, use the Single Step commands. When using these commands, even most complex liquid handlings can be programmed._

4.  #### _‌Process Control‌_

    \


    _For additional process control of the pipetting steps, the monitoring functions can be switched on and off for a single pipetting step or for a specific part of the method. The commands for the Monitored Air Displacement (MAD) and the Capacitive Clot Detection are functions of the library “HSLML\_STARLib”. To make the commands available, link the library to the method. Add the library to the method through the "Method  Libraries..._[_" Menu (refer to_ ](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark324)[_Section_ ](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark324)_11.12.10_[ ](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark324)[_ML STAR Library_](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark324)[_._](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark324)

5.  #### _‌Using Smart Steps‌_

    \


    _In this section, the general features of the "Pipette" Smart Step are explained by means of the “Simple Pipetting” Smart Step (the other variants of the “Pipette_[_” Command have similar wizards). More examples can be found in_ ](pipetting-steps.md#bookmark360)_Section 12 Demo Methods for the ML STAR._

    1.  _Drag one of the "Pipette" Smart Steps into the method window. The corresponding step of the "Pipette" Smart Step Wizard opens:_

        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1455.jpg)

        \

    2. _Use the drop down list to identify the instrument on which pipetting must be performed, as well as the aspirate and dispense sequences._
    3.  _Note that the sequences can also be indicated using arrays:_

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1456.jpg)
    4.  _Click the \[Next >] Button. The next page of the pipetting wizard will be activated._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1457.jpg)

        \

    5.  _Note that in this dialog the volume can also be specified using an array as shown below._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1458.jpg)
    6. _Define: the volume(s) for the pipetting process, a possible rest volume and its re-dispense target._
    7. _If a volume for “Simple“, “Replica” or “Pooling” is specified and exceeds the volume of the tip, multiple transfers with equally divided volumes will be performed automatically._

    _Rest Volume_

    _A residual volume “Rest volume” in the dialogs may be used for all pipetting modes too. This is handled at the end of a pipetting step after the (last) dispensing step. In the aliquot mode the additional handled residual volume is called “Post-aliquot” in contrast to the “Pre-aliquot”, which is handled before the aspirating step. The pre-aliquot is dispensed back into the aspiration sequence._

    _With the “Rest volume”, the choice is to discard it back into the aspiration sequence, or to dispense it into the waste container. In the previous example, a re-dispense height counted from the bottom of the container has to be given._

    1.  _Click the \[Next >] Button. The following pipetting wizard dialog will be displayed._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1459.jpg)

        \

    2. _Select the appropriate tip/needle handling which is the same for all dispense modes:_
    3. _First, select the tip sequence - where the tips are to be picked up from (here, an array can also be selected). The tip type is automatically retrieved from the sequence. If the tip sequence is used up, it will be automatically reloaded. As an additional feature, the tip sequence can be reduced during a reload._
    4. _Tip/needle handling can be specified, too (some items may not be selected, depending on the pipetting mode):_
       *   _Replace tips “After each dispense“ (if multiple dispenses are needed to transfer e.g. 900_

           _µl with a standard tip of 300 µl),_
       * _Only for replicas (and pooling) the option “After transferred volume“ becomes active. This allows the use of fresh tips even for multiple aspirations and multiple dispense cycles being performed with the same sample._
       * _“After each sample“ (multiple dispenses of the same sample are done with the same tip),_
       * _With “One tip set“, or_
       * _Without tip handling, “Never“. In this case, ML STAR will have to pick up tips prior to the pipette step and eject them after pipetting, using single steps._
    5. _A tip counter can be specified, which enables the user to start with a set of tips, partly used in previous runs at the correct position. To read a tip counter, it can be specified within the Smart Step “Load” (see corresponding section). A tip counter is specified by a name (e.g., “cntTips“). Be reminded to enclose the name in quotation marks._
    6. _Within the “Pipette” Smart Step, the current position of the tip sequence will continuously be stored under the name of the tip counter. Note that a tip counter has to be initialized if it is to be read by the “Load” Smart Step within the next run._
    7.  _Click the \[Next >] Button. The next page of the pipetting wizard will be displayed._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1460.jpg)
    8. _Define the dispense mode and the liquid class._
    9. _Define the aspiration and dispense (liquid handling) parameters used in the step._
    10. _The “Aspirate the complete requested volume without an error“ Checkbox enables aspiration of the residual liquid from a container (specify a volume larger than the expected residual volume within the container) without an error, even if there is not enough liquid available._
        * _For dispense, select the “Surface“ or “Jet“Dispense Mode._
        *   _For aspiration and dispense, specify the LLD (Liquid Level Detection) settings by clicking the \[LLD] Button. Below is how the “Aspirate LLD” Screen should look like._

            \


            ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1461.jpg)

            \

    11. _Within the LLD dialog, capacitance, pressure, both LLD types or none may be selected._
        * _A sensitivity setting is necessary. Either use the predefined settings from the Labware or override these settings with Very high / High / Medium or Low._
        * _If no LLD is used in aspiration and jet dispensing cannot work with LLD, the height from the bottom has to be defined._
        * _If any LLD is used either for aspiration or dispense, a submerge depth has to be specified. For the parallel use of both LLD types, only selectable for aspiration, a maximum height difference has to be given within which both LLDs have to respond._
    12. _Click \[OK], to close the “Aspirate LLD” Screen._
    13. _In the “Pipetting Wizard” Screen, click the \[Advanced...] Button, to specify the options “Pre- rinsing” and “Liquid following”. Below is how the “Dispense” Screen looks like. Click \[OK], to close the “Dispense” Screen._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1462.jpg)

        \

    14. _Here in the “Channel Settings” Dialog, the user is allowed to specify a channel pattern manually, as well as the number of the channels which will be used to calibrate (1536-well) carriers._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1463.jpg)
    15. _Click the \[Next >] Button. The last page of the pipetting wizard will be displayed._

        \


        ![image](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1464.jpg)

        \

    16. _Select the appropriate controlling sequence by activating the radio button. As long as both sequences are of the same length, this selection does not influence the pipetting (if no pipetting error occurs)._

    \


    _Sequence handling for Aliquot procedure_

    _In the case of aliquoting, the dispense sequence is always the controlling sequence._

    \


    _Sequence Handling in Pipetting Mode “Simple”_

    _Consider a situation where the aspiration sequence comprises 8 tubes, and the dispense sequence is a 96-well plate. What should be done now with the 88 remaining positions within the plate? If the aspiration sequence is controlling, the dispense sequence is reduced to the length of the aspiration sequence and the pipetting stops after dispensing into the first 8 positions of the plate sequence. If the dispense sequence is controlling, the aspiration sequence will be repeated until it reaches the length of the dispense sequence. This results in multiple transfers (12 for an 8- channel instrument) from the same 8 tubes to fill the complete plate. Then the (controlling) dispense sequence is finished and pipetting stops._

    ![Originalbild anzeigen](../../../.gitbook/assets/Image\_1465.jpg)

    _NOTE_

    _The “Pipette” Smart Step always equalizes the length of aspiration and dispense sequences._

    \


    _The following table gives an overview of the different situations and examples._
