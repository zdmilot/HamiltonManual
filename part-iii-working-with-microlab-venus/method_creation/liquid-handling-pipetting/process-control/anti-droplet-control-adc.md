# Anti-Droplet Control (ADC)‌

_The Anti-Droplet Control (ADC) function offers a way to prevent droplet formation at the tip of tips or needles while pipetting highly volatile liquids._

_These liquids cause droplets because the high vapor pressure of the volatile solvents (e.g. acetone, ethanol, diethyl ether) results in a pressure increase in the tip. This pressure will push the liquid out of the tip (fig A and B)._

_The working principle of ADC is to measure the pressure inside the pipetting channel (with the built-in pressure sensor) and compensate the increasing pressure by moving the piston upwards. The evaporated volume of the liquid will now be compensated._\
