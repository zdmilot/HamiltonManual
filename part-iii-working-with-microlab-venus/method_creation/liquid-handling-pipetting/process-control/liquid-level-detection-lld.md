# Liquid Level Detection, LLD

## Capacitive Liquid Level Detection, cLLD

If conductive liquids are to be pipetted, Hamilton recommends using the advantage of the capacitive LLD. The sensitivity of the capacitive LLD that is to be used depends on the vessel size and the conductivity (or polarity) of the liquid that is to be detected. For a solution of 0.1% NaCl in distilled water, the required sensitivities are:

| <p>cLLD</p><p>setting</p> | Sensitivity level | Vessel                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                         | Very High         | 384-well plates                                      |
| 2                         | High              | 96-well round-bottom plates                          |
| 3                         | Medium            | 96-well flat-bottom plates                           |
| 4                         | Low               | Tubes, reagent reservoirs or any other large vessels |

The following table gives the minimum volume a single pipetting channel can detect in various containers for the capacitive Liquid Level Detection.

## Pressure Liquid Level Detection, pLLD

When pipetting non-conductive liquids or in the case of an insufficient electrical coupling between the container bottom and the carrier, Hamilton recommends to use the advantage of pressure LLD.

Settings available for example, the 1000µl-pipetting channels:

| pLLD Setting | Sensitivity level | Tip      | Liquid                           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1            | Very High         | Standard | Low boiling point, low viscosity |
| 2            | High              | High     | Low boiling point, low viscosity |
| 3            | Medium            | Standard | Water or higher viscosity        |
| 4            | Low               | High     | Water or higher viscosity        |

In the case of aspiration from foaming liquids, capacitive Liquid Level Detection in particular may not detect the surface properly. As an alternative, try pressure LLD, or a combination of both. If a combination of both LLD types is used, the maximum height difference between the two independent LLDs can be used as a parameter.
