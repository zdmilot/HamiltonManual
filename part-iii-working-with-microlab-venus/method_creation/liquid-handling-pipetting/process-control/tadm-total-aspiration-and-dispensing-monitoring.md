# TADM – Total Aspiration and Dispensing Monitoring

TADM (Total Aspiration and Dispensing Monitoring) is a tool to increase the safety and the robustness of pipetting processes. However, it is not part of the standard software package.&#x20;

The Principle of TADM&#x20;

The pressure inside each individual pipetting channel is constantly recorded during aspiration and dispensing. The values obtained by the pressure sensor during a pipetting step (aspiration or dispensing) can be compared to values defined by the user. This allows real-time monitoring of the pipetting process.&#x20;

The differences between error-free pipetting steps and erroneous ones are used to distinguish the results of the pipetting steps. Basically, there are two types of errors that can be detected:&#x20;

* Pressure above normal (overpressure)&#x20;
* Pressure below normal (underpressure)&#x20;

TADM verifies that a sample has been transferred with a traceable digital audit trail which is particularly beneficial for _In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD)_ laboratories.&#x20;

Peaks and fraying of TADM curves can be a sign that the liquid class and / or the pipetting process are not defined in a precise and robust way. With the help of TADM, the pipetting process can thus be optimized and made more robust.&#x20;
