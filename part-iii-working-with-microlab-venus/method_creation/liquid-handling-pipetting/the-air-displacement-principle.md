# The Air Displacement Principle‌

The ML STAR is based on the air displacement pipetting principle, comparable to the work principle of handheld pipettes.

Air displacement means that the liquid is aspirated into and dispensed from a disposable tip or needle by the movement of a plunger. There is air between the plunger and the liquid surface. No system liquid of any kind is involved in the ML STAR. On the ML STAR, the pipetting of volumes from 0.5µl up to 5ml are processed. Filter tips can be used to avoid contamination by aerosol.
