# 3rd Party Equipment‌

_There is a wide range of ML STAR integrated devices for many applications to choose from._

_The commands for these devices are functions of the additional libraries. These libraries are not part of the basic software package and need to be ordered in addition._

_In order to make the library functions available, install the library into the folder_

_“…\Hamilton\Library”._
