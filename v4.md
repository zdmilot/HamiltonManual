3. ‌Hamilton System Configuration Editor‌
=================

The ML STAR is available in several configurations. Use the Hamilton System Configuration Editor to configure the VENUS Software to a specific instrument configuration. The primary configuration will be done by the Hamilton Trained Field Service Engineer during the instrument installation.

The simulator runs with the same configuration as the instrument. If the VENUS Software is installed on a PC without a connected instrument, it is possible to configure the simulator manually to the instrument configuration, for which the method is intended to be written. Some configuration options are not instrument\-dependent and have to be edited in any case.

To open the “Hamilton System Configuration Editor”, start the “Method Editor” and click from the “Tools  System Configuration Editor” Menu.

Or double\-click the “**Hamilton.HxConfigEditor.exe**” in the directory “**HAMILTON\\bin**”. The “**Hamilton System Configuration Editor**” opens as shown in the image below.

When the “**Hamilton System Configuration Editor**” has been activated, the first decision to be made – prior to the run – is whether to run the method with a real instrument or to simulate the run without using the instrument. Run simulation is a tool for testing whether a method has been programmed correctly. The run simulator creates a method trace file with pipetting pattern and other useful information.

		NOTE
		
		TADM settings are only available if the ML STAR VENUS TADM feature 5\.1 is installed. For more information, contact a local Hamilton Representative.
		
		VENUS TADM Feature 5\.1 records and monitors pressure curves for every individual pipetting channel. It defines customized tolerance bands for acceptable pipetting limits and detects a wide variety of pipetting errors and sample conditions. TADM features help in customizing liquid classes and monitor processes at the same time gives the opportunity to have a look inside the pipetting channel. With VENUS M Software, the TADM test aspiration pressure curves are analysed to indicate pipetting performance.
4. ‌ML VENUS Software Tour‌
===

VENUS Software allows programming the ML STAR instrument according to the needs of the workflow and assay. Like any other software by Hamilton, Hamilton\-specific terms are used. Some terms are explained in short summaries to make the programming easier.

The second part of this section shows an example on how to create programs.

  



	1. ‌Overview‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	The master editor called the “**Method Editor**” combines several sub\-editors, which helps optimize the workflow and pipetting results. There are two ways of displaying a method.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (240\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="613" height\="321">
	
	Toolbox
	
	Method
	
	First option is to use the step oriented method editor. Here, the method is created by adding steps from the toolbox to the step oriented “**Method Editor**”.
	
	  
	
	
	The second option is through the “**Action Editor**”. The Action Editor offers a more visual representation of the method.
	
	The selected actions in the toolbox can be dragged and dropped to the editor window. Arrows show the chronological order of the process.
	
	Both editors are using the same set of data. The editors, however, use different ways to display data.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (241\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="626" height\="399">
	
	2\. Action Editor
	
	1\. Method Editor
	
	To switch between both views, use the following icons:
	2. ‌Methods‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	Programming ML STAR instruments always means creating new or adapting existing methods. A method is a list of instructions for the instrument, appearing as actions, steps, transport steps, loops, user dialogs, etc.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (242\).gif" alt\="screen 5" data\-size\="original" width\="398" height\="178">
	
	The user software offers various standard step libraries such as the general steps, the pipetting steps, etc. while the ML STAR instrument software offers different levels of programming.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (243\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="254" height\="107">
	
	Smart Steps combine tasks. For example, combining a complete pipetting task with a plate copy, aliquoting, pooling, etc. These commands are best for beginners to get familiar with the system. They incorporate a guided programming wizard, predefined error recoveries and customized recovery strategies.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (244\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="254" height\="250">
	
	Easy Steps are for pipetting and plate handling. They offer a wider range of settings and possibilities to handle errors than the smart steps. “Easy Steps” Icons have yellow backgrounds.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (245\).gif" alt\="single step" data\-size\="original" width\="262" height\="20"> Single Steps are used when highest flexibility of the system is required. These commands allow even the most complex pipetting and plate handling tasks. Single steps have the suffix “Single Step”.
	
	  
	
	
	Aside from the standard step libraries, additional libraries for advanced programming are also available.
	
	Each method is linked to a **System Deck** which is an empty environment upon opening. Now, the programmer has to plot the real environment in the software by adding first a ML STAR instrument to the system deck.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (246\).gif" alt\="System deck" data\-size\="original" width\="532" height\="180">
	
	After successfully adding a ML STAR instrument, choose between two different views in the deck editor. The first view is the **System** Tab which shows an external perspective of the instrument, including 3rd party components.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (247\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="547" height\="220">
	
	  
	
	
	The **ML\_STAR** Tab shows an internal perspective of the instrument which is the deck layout. This is a graphical illustration of the work surface of the ML STAR instrument. It contains all information about the used labware and x/y/z coordinates of the positions.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (248\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="541" height\="223">
	
	  
	
	
	The ML STAR can be used with various kinds of labware such as: Tubes, Microplates, Reagent Troughs, etc. The software comes with a set of standard labware definitions. Labware is available by clicking the Labware Tab found in the Deck Layout Editor.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (249\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="560" height\="124">
	
	To allow easier access to any kind of labware, use the view selection found on the right side of the labware view window. The deck layout is displayed in 3D and can be rotated to any angle.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (250\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="428" height\="202">
	
	  
	
	
	Choose among the different views:
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (251\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="27" height\="177">
	
	
		* 3D View
		* Front View
		* Back View
		* Top View
		* Bottom View
		* Left View
		* Right View  
	
	
	The clipping function will allow cutting off overlaying labware from the labware placed underneath. This makes the creation of, for example, sequences very simple.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (252\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="22" height\="82">
	
	Please make sure that the deck view has an appropriate size at different z\-heights (CVS / BVS), otherwise the clipping slider will not be shown.
	
	If a labware of a different or new kind must be defined, the “**Labware Editor**” helps in defining the new labware.

Adding labware and carriers onto the deck layout is easy (refer to](#bookmark157) [Section 6\.2 Adding Labware](#bookmark157) on[the](#bookmark157) Deck). The deck layout contains all geometrical information the instrument requires for the pipetting and plate handling steps.

		In the programming phase, the programmer will add steps to the step editor or add actions to the action editor view. Adding a step or adding an action will both prompt a user dialog to request the necessary values for the instrument.
5. ‌Editor Details‌
================


	1. ‌Method Editor‌
	------
	
	  
	
	
	Methods are programs that string together a number of specified commands (such as aspirate or dispense) to instruct the instrument to perform a function. They can be as complex as or as simple as the programmer desires. Access to a method editor is necessary to define or edit methods.
	
	Action Editor
	
	The action editor view is a very simplified way to program methods. In the toolbox of the action editor, all possible actions on an instrument can be found. “Drag and Drop” of an action will invoke a wizard to get all necessary information from the user. At the end, a graphic view of a method is shown.
	
	Graphical Method Editor
	
	The graphical method editor (called method editor) is a syntax\-free editor that presents a group\-like graphical editing environment. Common constructions such as loops, conditionals and built\-in functions are supported by this editor. It also provides a variable management system. This system simplifies variable usage by allowing implicit declarations and by supplying complete variable context to edit dialogs.
	
	The output of the method editor is a linked set of files that may be executed by the *Run Control*. In most cases (but not necessarily), a method refers to one single deck layout.
	
	
		1. ### ‌Views and Windows‌
		
		  
		
		
		The method editor is divided into multiple attachable windows (these are empty during start\-up):
		
		Changing the View
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (263\).gif" alt\="top menu view" data\-size\="original" width\="136" height\="330">
		
		These windows can be activated by selecting the “**View**” Menu:
		2. ### ‌Toolbars‌
		
		  
		
		
		The toolbars contains some of the most frequently used commands to be executed directly by a mouse click. The toolbar can be docked or detached by a drag and drop.
		
		The “**Tool Bar**” Icons are shown on the left of the corresponding menu functions.

		4. ### ‌Method Export and Import‌
		
		  
		
		
		Exporting and importing methods allow interchanging of methods between different PC’s. Once a method has been created and tested, it can then be packed in a single file with all the relevant information which includes the following:
		
		
			* Method
			* System Deck
			* Required Labware
			* Required Liquid Classes
			* Included Libraries (standard and self\-created)It is also possible to add files to the package that are needed to execute the method but are not part of the Hamilton Software.
		
		Example: an Excel sheet that is read to define the sample volumes.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (285\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="215" height\="175">
		
		To do so, select Method  Dependencies and add all files that shall be part of the export package.
		
		  
		
		
		The advantage of such an export\-import transfer is that not all labware, libraries, etc. have to be installed by default on another PC. Such transfer of files ensures that all information will be stored on the target PC when the package is imported.
		
		Exporting methods is also a useful procedure for backing up the methods.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (286\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		All data will be compressed, so a complete method can be transferred easily even through e\-mail.
		
		
			1. ‌Exporting a Method
			
			  
			
			
			To collect all information used by a method, and to create one package file, follow the steps shown below.
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (287\).gif" alt\="export file\_1" data\-size\="original" width\="125" height\="150">
			
			Choose “File  Export…” within the method to be transferred. A dialog box will open, requesting for a filename.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (288\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="272" height\="274">
			
			Click the **\[…]** Button to select the package name including the path desired to export.
			
			Click **\[Finish]** to complete the operation.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (289\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			If a method has never been run on an instrument – neither on the simulator nor on a real instrument – not all data may be collected. It is recommended to run a simulation before creating a package for exporting.
			2. ‌Importing a Method
			
			  
			
			
			The method in a package must be imported once received. To do this, perform the following steps:
			
			
				1. Start the “Graphical Method Editor”.
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (290\).gif" alt\="import file\_3" data\-size\="original" width\="120" height\="151">
				2. Select among the “File  Import…” Menu
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (291\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="243" height\="244">
				3. Choose the desired package by clicking on **\[…]**
				4. Once a package is selected, the comment written during the export process will be seen along with the name or path of the package.
				5. If the selected package is not the desired one, click **\[…]** again to select another one.
				6. Click **\[Next \>]** to determine the location in which the package shall be unpacked.
				
				There are four different possibilities:
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (292\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML14a13c5" data\-size\="original" width\="323" height\="325">
				
				  
				
				
				Recovery: A useful way to restore a destroyed method. If the method was exported for backup purposes, re\-importing it while selecting the recovery option should be used. The same directory structure will be used to extract and store all the necessary files that were collected during the export procedure.
				
				Import into Default Directories: Useful when data should be stored in the default directories as defined in VENUS Software. An example is by using the labware directory to save labware files.
				
				Import into Sub\-Directories of Default Directories: Similar to the second possibility, however using this option will create sub\-directories to the default directories with the names specified. This option guarantees that the existing files having the same names with the new files will not be overwritten.
				
				User\-defined: Gives the most flexibility in selecting the target directories. The next step will ask for a definition of the target directory for all groups of files, method files, library files, labware files and other files.
				
				Import Original Hamilton Files: If this option is enabled, original Hamilton files are imported to a target environment, otherwise these files are skipped. This could however lead to non\-working methods.
				7. Click **\[Next \>]** again, to get to a summary of the current directories and, if necessary, further input fields and selection possibilities to change the desired directories. The summary will be updated on an ongoing basis with any changes that have been made.
				8. Once the selections correspond to the requirements click **\[Finish].** This will unpack and store all of the files.
				9. The system imports all necessary files and prompts the dialog below upon completion. Click\[Close] to exit.

	2. ‌Command Overview by Step Groups‌
	-----
	
	  
	
	
	The VENUS Software offers various standard **Command Libraries**. For the ML STAR instrument, the software offers three levels of commands which are:
	
	Smart Steps, which combine a complete pipetting task such as plate copy, serial dilution, pooling etc. Smart Steps are incorporated with customizable error handling which includes a guided programming wizard, predefined error recoveries and customized recovery strategies.
	
	Easy Steps, which are combinations of e.g. tip pickup and aspiration. Easy steps allow very flexible programming and also include full error handling. However, the sequence support is limited (e.g. for pipetting into all wells of the entire plate, a loop must be added).
	
	Single Step commands are used when highest flexibility of the system is required. These commands allow even the most complex pipetting and plate handling tasks. However, tip handling and sequence support are not included.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (302\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

		NOTE
		
		Once a deck layout has been linked to a method, the instrument specific steps will be visible in the toolbox.
		
		  
		
		
		Smart Steps are powerful commands for programming the ML STAR.
		
		Smart Steps combine many single steps for specific tasks like filling a microplate starting with tubes, aliquoting a reagent to a complete plate, loading the deck, etc. The available Smart Steps are listed in the following table.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (343\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="5" height\="1">
		
		[To use instrument\-specific steps (load, pipette, etc.) the method has to be linked to an existing deck layout first (see](#bookmark179) [Section 7\.1 New](#bookmark179) Method) while keeping the “**Smart Steps**” Checkbox selected.

		The method editor allows free combination of Smart Steps, Easy Steps and Single Steps.
		
		For all Smart Steps, the instrument name is to be selected. This is set by default to the ML STAR short name and cannot be changed within the Smart Steps.
		
		A selection is necessary only in the case of two or more instruments linked together.
		3. ### ‌ML STAR Easy Steps‌
		
		  
		
		
		The EASY Steps belong to the “**ML STAR**” Group found in the method editor toolbox window. These commands are indicated by orange\-colored backgrounds of the icons.

		4. ### ‌ML STAR Single Steps‌
		
		  
		
		
		Single steps are restricted to single actions like picking up tips, aspirate, dispense, etc.
		
		[To make them available, enable them through the System Configuration Editor. Refer to](#bookmark62) [Section](#bookmark62)
		
		3\.1 System Settings.
		
		The Single Steps belong to the “**ML STAR**” Group found in the method editor toolbox window with the suffix “**Single Step**”.
		
		The tables found on the next pages supply brief overviews of the available STAR\-specific commands. These commands are used in both the graphical and the HSL method editors. In the tree view of the “**ML STAR**” Group, the commands are structured in sub\-groups (Liquid handling, Preparation, Transport, Miscellaneous), some in further sub\-groups (Channels, CO\-RE 96 Probe Head, CO\-RE 384 Probe Head, Nano Pipettor, iSWAP, CO\-RE Grip).

	3. ‌System Deck‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	The System Deck Editor window can display two different views of the instrument.
	
	The system view (available by pressing the System Tab in the lower left of the window) shows the instrument from the outside including all surrounding instruments such as 3rd party components etc. The programmer is able to design the real environment in the software by adding instruments (e.g. ML STAR pipetting workstation, rack runner plate handling robot, etc.) and other devices (e.g. readers, washers, incubators, plate hotels, etc.) onto the system deck.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (472\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="54" height\="54">
	
	NOTE
	
	Instruments added on the system deck are **graphical representations** of the instruments only. In order to control these instruments, driver libraries must be added to the method.
	
	The System Tab shows the ML STAR instrument in 3D view.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (473\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="498" height\="380">
	
	The “**ML\_STAR**” Tab shows the deck layout of the ML STAR in 3D view.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (474\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="490" height\="381">
	
	Each added instrument will be represented by its specific instrument tab.
	
	The STAR instrument is represented by a deck. A deck layout is a graphical illustration of the work surface of a pipetting robot. It contains all the information about the carriers and labware being used as well as the x/y/z coordinates of the positions.
	4. ‌Sequences‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Definition
	
	VENUS Software uses sequences for pipetting, transport, tip handling etc.
	
	A sequence is a list that specifies the order of execution. A sequence contains three columns:
	
	Index \- column that identifies each sequence position.
	
	Labware ID \- specifies the labware on which the position is defined (e.g. Plate) Position ID \- container on which the sequence position is defined (e.g. Well A1\) Refer to the example shown below.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (475\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="207" height\="150">
	
	HAM\_DW\_12\_ml\_0001

Example:

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (476\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="195" height\="149"> 

Almost every action of an instrument needs two sequences: a source and a target sequence. This is true for pipetting from an aspirate to a dispense sequence, when transporting labware from the getPlate sequence to the placePlate sequence, when coupling tips from the pickup sequence and ejecting it to the waste sequence etc.

Pointers:

Every sequence (such as the ones shown below) has three pointers which may change during a run:

* Current position (which is the ***next available*** position in the sequence)
* End position (the ***last position*** to be used)
* Total number of elements (the overall length of the sequence)

| A **default sequence** is created automatically when plates or tube racks are placed on the deck. The sorting of these sequences is depending on the selected stamp tool. |

| Having for instance, the stamp tool for the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head activated, the default sequence will be optimized to be processed with this head. |

Cos\_384\_Sq\_0001

Custom sequences can be defined graphically in two ways:

1. By clicking on each appropriate well on the plate or tube rack
2. By using the rubber band zoom

In both ways, the current selected “**Stamp Tool**” is used to sort the added position.

  


Example:

On the STAR, an action to aspirate samples from tubes and dispense into microplates in a manner that will be free of contamination – in which case disposable tips will be preferred.

The example describes such a method:

  


Method: 1\. Pick up Tips


	1. Aspirate from Samples
	2. Dispense to Plates
	3. Eject to Waste

Definitions

* A **Method** describes operations on sequences.
* A **Deck Layout** describes the physical positions of labware on the instrument deck.
* A **Labware** item describes the geometry of parts which can be dealt with as a whole, such as the wells of a Microplate, or which can be combined on the deck, such as a carrier holding several plates.
* A **Sequence** describes the order in which labware positions are to be processed on the instrument’s deck.

  


Advantage of Using Sequences

The advantage of working with sequences is the unrivalled flexibility.

[As described in the](#bookmark128) [Section 5\.3 System Deck](#bookmark128), VENUS Software obtains the coordinates of the pipetting spots out of sequences.

In an example of a 96\-well Microplate and the 8\-Pipetting Channel STAR, the default pipetting order is:

  




| 1st pipetting: 2nd pipetting: 3rd pipetting: 4th pipetting:… | A1; B1; C1; D1; E1; F1; G1; H1 ( \= column 1\) A2; B2; C2; D2; E2; F2; G2; H2 ( \= column 2\) A3; B3; C3; D3; E3; F3; G3; H3 ( \= column 3\) A4; B4; C4; D4; E4; F4; G4; H4 ( \= column 4\)… |
| --- | --- |

 <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (484\).jpg" alt\="MTP" data\-size\="original" width\="151" height\="99">

[Because labware is represented by a sequence (refer to](#bookmark129) Section 5\.4 Sequences) there is the ability to change the order of the pipetting steps, for example:

* Excluding of complete columns or single wells
* Sorting the pipetting spots by the characteristics of the: x\-/y\- coordinates, Position ID, etc.

Another advantage of the sequence philosophy is the possibility of merging several sequences like in the case of reformatting four 96\-well Microplates to one 384\-well Microplate.

Now all of the pipetting spots of the 96\-well plates are merged into one sequence.

Only **one pipetting step** is now needed because of merging the 96\-well Microplates to one source sequence.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (485\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="413" height\="264">

The programming of the reformatting steps then becomes much easier. Within only one pipetting step, all wells of the four 96\-well Microplates can be transferred to the 384\-well Microplate.

  


1. ‌Labware‌


  


The software comes with a set of definitions for the standard labware items that are most commonly used in laboratories. The carrier name and definition selected must always be identical to the name with which the physical carrier is labeled.

A carrier feature is a varying number of locations for the placement of labware, such as tip racks, microplates, etc.

For the standard carriers and their names, refer directly to the software list which is shown through an image in the next page. The list box displays the available labware names. The selected piece of labware is defined briefly on the right\-hand side of the window with its corresponding picture.

The benefits of a plate carrier to the left of Track 1 are:


	* Higher deck density, lower reloads
	* Work positions available for Multi\-Probe Heads
	* Labware storage positions available for iSWAP / CO\-RE Grips  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (486\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="173" height\="256">

  


Definition

A **labware** item describes the geometry of objects which can be dealt with as a whole, such as the wells of a microplate, or which can be combined on the deck, such as a carrier holding several plates.

The ML STAR can be used with all kind of labware such as tubes, microplates, reagent troughs, etc. VENUS Software comes with a set of standard labware definitions.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (487\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="474" height\="118">

Pre\-loaded Tips and Tube Carriers

In addition to plate and tip carriers, sample carriers can also be placed on the deck. These carriers are pre\-loaded with tubes of a specified size (diameter and length). In fact, these carriers are racks (\*.rck) in contrast to the other carriers, which are carrier templates (\*.tml). The tube carriers are examples of racks which fit directly into the track grids of the ML STAR.

There are also pre\-loaded racks and carriers available, for example, a tip carrier equipped with standard tips (TIP\_CAR\_480\_ST\_A00\) and more.

	1. ### ‌Types of Labware‌
	
	  
	
	
	Containers
	
	Containers are vessels which hold liquids. They are usually placed in racks. They can also be placed directly onto the carriers, which is the case with reagent containers. An example for containers would be the tubes or the wells of a Microplate.
	
	The filename has the extension “**.ctr**”.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (492\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Pipetting is only done into containers! Sequences can be created on containers only!
	
	CO\-RE tips and needles are also defined as containers.
	
	  
	
	
	Rectangular Racks and Plates
	
	Rectangular racks are specialized grids for holding containers (or tips) in row and column order. A Microplate is a rack in this circumstance and the wells represent as containers. The rack is therefore a template describing a discrete number of positions for holding containers (or tips).
	
	Examples of racks include a tube rack, a Microplate, a microtiter strip, a deep\-well plate, and a tip rack.
	
	The filename has the extension “**.rck**”.
	
	Circular Racks
	
	Circular racks are specialized grids for holding containers in a segment of a circle. The filename has the extension “**.crk**”.
	2. ### ‌Reference Position‌
	
	  
	
	
	The command dialogs always use the container bottom as a reference position (fixed height, liquid level \= 0\).
	
	The x, y, z values of the reference well (usually A1 or \#1\) stored in the instrument’s system of coordinates are shown in the “**Adjust Labware Position**” Dialog.
	
	To access this dialog:
	
	
		1. Switch to the System Deck Editor.
		2. Select the labware (Plate, TipRack etc.) to be used.
		3. Right click on the labware item to enter the Context Menu.
		4. Select “**Adjust Location**”.
		5. The dialog box shown below will appear.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (493\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="558" height\="291">
	3. ### ‌Height Parameters‌
	
	  
	
	
	Both the rack and the container have clearance heights. This is the minimal height at which the pipetting channels must pass over the labware so that their movement is not blocked by the labware. The software automatically takes the highest clearance height.
	
	The maximum pipetting height is the deepest position the tip or needle can be placed inside a well. It is counted from the bottom of the container upwards and determines the dead volume of the container.
	
	The LLD search height is the height at which the speed of the pipetting channel is reduced to look for the liquid surface.

	| H: | Origin Z (also called “Base Offset”) |
	| I: | Snap to site of base of rack or to container |
	
	Regarding the z position, two different cases of rack placement on the deck can be distinguished in the STAR which is controlled by the switch “I” in the sketch above:
	
	
		* Snap to base of rack
		* Snap to base of containerThese two cases are described in detail on the next page.
	
	A “**Container\-Based**” Rack is placed with the container bottom directly on the carrier (e.g. the microplates on a plate carrier):

	The reference position Z0 is the lowest position in the well. Here, the reference height is calculated from
	
	Z0 \= Zdeck\+Zcarrier\+Zthick , Zdeck is fixed at 100mm,
	
	Zthick (D) is defined in the container labware,
	
	Zcarrier (H) is defined in the carrier template definition.
	
	A “**Rack\-Based**” Rack is placed with the frame on the instrument deck (e.g., a tube rack, where Zcarrier (H) \= 0, because the tube rack is used directly as a carrier)

	==================

2. ‌How to Create a Deck Layout‌
========

In the deck layout section of the method editor, the programmer declares what labware (carriers, racks or containers) is used in the procedure and where these items are positioned on the deck. This action is called “**Defining a Deck Layout**”.

Creating a new method will also create a deck layout with the same name as the method.

  



	1. ‌New Deck Layout‌
	--------
	
	  
	
	
	The easiest way to have a new deck layout is to create a new method. This will automatically create a new deck with the same name.
	
	To access the newly created deck, simply click on the System Deck Icon:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (497\).gif" alt\="toolbar\_1" data\-size\="original" width\="441" height\="30">
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (498\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="8" height\="25">
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (499\).gif" alt\="toolbar\_1" data\-size\="original" width\="30" height\="30">
	
	System Deck
	
	  
	
	
	It is possible to create a deck layout without creating a new method. To do this, select “File  New
	
	 System Deck” in the Method Editor.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (500\).gif" alt\="new file screen" data\-size\="original" width\="338" height\="85">
	
	  
	
	
	Fill out the dialog box being prompted as shown below.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (501\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="479" height\="238">
	
	
		* “**Open existing system or instrument layout**”, to base the deck layout on an existing layout or on a template.
		* “**Use template to create a new system**” with an instrument\-specific definition of dimensions, main grid and hidden grids, with pre\-loaded standard labware such as a waste container. Deck templates can be customized.
		* “**Use instrument to create a new system**”, to base a layout on the layout of the connected instrument. This is the most common way to start.
		* “**Create an empty bench**” to start creating a layout with an empty deck.  
	
	
	Once a choice have been made and possibly browsed for an existing template or layout, the menu bar now includes the “**System Deck**” Menu and the “**System Deck**” Window will be displayed. The Deck Layout shows the tracks of the predefined grids from the appropriate deck template.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (502\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="489" height\="321">
	
	  
	
	
	Use the tabs in the left lower corner of the window, highlighted above, to switch between the system view (full instrument and third party components) and the instrument tab (here: ML\_STAR) to see the instrument deck.
	
	The functional panel found on the top right corner of the window can be used to see the layer selection, the (labware) preview or the stamp tool selection:

		1. ### ‌System Deck Options‌
		
		  
		
		
		
			1. The “System Deck  Options” Menu includes settings for the appearance of the System Deck.
			
			It is possible to:
			
			
				* Show (or hide) labware tooltips
				* Show (or hide) labware names and specify the text size
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (515\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="463" height\="211">
			2. Clicking the **\[Advanced 3D view Options…]** prompts the settings for the:
			
			
				* Windows™ based or PX5\-based control style
				* render quality
				* selection of graphic device for the computer  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (516\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="329" height\="243">
		2. ### ‌Save System Deck‌
		
		  
		
		
		The complete loading of the deck may be stored under a programmer\-defined file name with an extension “**.lay**”, for example, “**MyDemo.lay**”. This is done using the “**Save**” or the “**Save Copy as...**” command found in the “**File**” Menu.
		3. ### ‌Open Existing Deck Layouts‌
		
		  
		
		
		It is possible to load previously defined deck layouts (extension “**.lay**”) by selecting “**File**  **Open**” in the “**File**” Menu or by activating the \[<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (517\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="30" height\="27">] Button in the toolbar.
	2. ‌Adding Labware on the Deck‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Introduction‌
		
		  
		
		
		Practically, a deck can be configured freely. Here, the term “**Labware**” refers to the carriers (available from Hamilton), reagent troughs, microplates, sample tubes (from various manufacturers) and tip racks.
		
		The general steps are as follows:
		
		
			1. Add a **carrier** to the deck
			2. Add the **plate** to the carrierIt is possible to mix plates on a carrier; like adding Microplates to a Deep Well Plate Carrier. However, please keep in mind that the laser line of the Autoload reads at a specific height and will not be able to read barcodes on the Microplates if they are located on a Deep Well Plate carrier.
		2. ### ‌Adding a Carrier by the Search Labware Function‌
		
		  
		
		
		To add labware to the deck layout, make sure the “**Labware**” Tab is selected, highlighted on the picture below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (518\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="176" height\="28">
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (519\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
		
		ATTENTION
		
		If a tube carrier is placed directly adjacent to a plate or a tip carrier, using low volume tips may lead to a collision when the pipetting channel moves down to aspirate from the bottom of the tubes. Pipetting channels with low volume tips fitted cannot reach the deck surface. (Δz \= 14\.5 mm, zmin \= 114,5 mm from origin) In this case, use larger tip sizes.
		
		  
		
		
		The “**Search Labware**” Function is a powerful tool that simplifies the deck layout creation. Instead of browsing through the tree structure, a simple query in the “**Search Labware**” Field helps in finding the desired labware quickly.
		
		To add a plate carrier to the deck layout, use the “**Search Labware**” Field found on top of the labware window, highlighted on the image below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (520\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="391" height\="124">
		
		  
		
		
		To find a labware, enter search criteria in the text field. The box right below the text field will display all the matching results based on the specified search string. Please note that not only the labware name, but also its description in plain text is scanned to generate the matching results.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (521\).gif" alt\="sample car" data\-size\="original" width\="313" height\="150">
		
		Example:
		
		Entering **sample car** will list all matching pre\- loaded sample carriers.
		
		  
		
		
		Select the desired carrier and “Drag and Drop” the item onto the deck layout.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (522\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		Although it is very simple to find any kind of labware with the “**Search Labware**” Assistant, make sure that the deck layout does contain the same carriers as loaded on the real deck.
		3. ### ‌Adding a Carrier through Tree Selection‌
		
		  
		
		
		Another way to find the labware for the deck is to use the tree structure of the labware. Click the “**Labware**” Tab in the “**Deck Layout**” Window.
		
		In the tree view located on the left side of the window, click **\[Plate carriers]** (ML STAR Carriers). The list view in the center shows the available plate carriers.
		
		In the list view located on the center of the window, click the carrier that should be placed on the deck. An image of the carrier with its corresponding description will be shown on the right most side of the window. Click on the image of the carrier and “Drag and Drop” it to the appropriate location on the deck. All these are shown in the picture below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (523\).gif" alt\="pltcar" data\-size\="original" width\="642" height\="167">
		
		The place where the carrier will be dropped is indicated by a frame during this operation.
		
		The carrier, once dropped, is added onto the deck layout and is projected on the left side of the deck as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (524\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="537" height\="169">
		
		VENUS M allows for optimal use of deck space, allowing to place carriers in the minus (left of Track 1 (\-3 to \+3\)) area.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (525\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="460" height\="268">
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (526\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="204" height\="301">
		
		The benefits of a plate carrier to the left of Track 1 are:
		
		
			* Higher deck density, lower reloads
			* Work positions available for Multi\- Probe Heads
			* Labware storage positions available for iSWAP / CO\-RE Grips
		4. ### ‌Adding a Plate to the Carrier‌
		
		  
		
		
		The next step is to add a plate to the carrier. The corresponding labware (plates, tip racks, etc.) is sorted by manufacturer and stored within the labware directory. Standard plates from almost every major manufacturer (Nunc, Falcon, Greiner, etc.) are available. These names (or brands) can also be entered directly in the “**Search Labware**” Field.
		
		Microplates, tip racks, etc. are labware items that are generally called “**Racks**” and have “**.rck**” file name extensions.
		
		To add a plate to the carrier, open the “**Plates**” Group from the tree list on the top left of the deck layout window. The different groups of plates are displayed in the list.
		
		In the “**Plate**” List, click to select the appropriate plate group. In the list view found on the center of the window, the plates belonging to the group are shown.
		
		Click the desired plate type from the list. An image of the plate with its corresponding description will be presented on the right most side of the window. Click the plate and “Drag and Drop” it onto the location of the appropriate plate carrier. These are shown in the image below.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (527\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="630" height\="174">
		
		The spot on the carrier where the plate will be dropped is indicated by a green frame during this action. The plate, once dropped, is added to the deck layout and is projected on the carrier found on the lower left side of the deck, as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (528\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="543" height\="170">
		
		  
		
		
		When hovered, the tool tip info shows the name of the carrier and its position.
		
		Plates (or labware) on a carrier may be moved between sites by simply “Dragging and Dropping”.
	3. ‌Adding a Plate directly onto the Deck‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	Labware, as seen in the example below, can also be placed directly onto the instrument deck without using a carrier.
	
	Drag and drop the item from the image view onto the deck (see the image below). The item is placed wherever the left mouse button is released.
	
	To define the position of the item according to its coordinates, select the item and right\-click to enter the Context Menu. Select **\[Adjust Location…]** to trigger the settings dialog.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (529\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="553" height\="177">
	
	A dialog box which allows settings specification will appear, as presented below.
	
	Use the "**Absolute Rotation**" Settings to rotate the labware item freely “**Other**” or in increments of 90° clockwise.
	
	Enter the desired position coordinates in the entry fields of “**Location**” for the reference point of the selected labware. The reference point is marked red (usually A1 for plates). Note that there is a 100 mm offset from the origin to the deck. Meaning, a plate placed directly on the deck’s surface will have a Z\-coordinate of 100 mm.
	
	Click **\[OK]** to close the dialog.

	4. ‌Removing Labware‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	To remove labware items from the deck:
	
	
		1. Right\-click the labware item to be deleted.
		2. Select “**Delete**” from the Context Menu. The labware item is deleted from the deck.
	5. ‌View Properties of Labware / Rename Labware‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	To rename a given labware item:
	
	
		1. Right\-click the labware item to be renamed.
		2. Select “**Properties**” from the Context Menu. The labware properties dialog box will appear, showing the properties of the selected labware.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (532\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="218" height\="226"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (533\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="321" height\="249">
		3. In the labware properties dialog box, the “**Labware ID**”, the “**Barcode mask**”, the visibility, and the labware’s properties or definition (if these data are not write\-protected) can be changed.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (534\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
	
	ATTENTION
	
	Be careful when using 50 µl und 300 µl CO\-RE tips on the same deck layout. Do not confuse one tip type with the other during the process of loading the deck. Check the label of the tip rack to see where the tip volume, in plain text, can be seen. Using an Autoload, activate the checkbox for the barcode mask of the tip racks. This will read the barcode label of the tip racks during loading time and prompts a message if the tips loaded are not the expected tips. The same goes when using 300 µl Slim and 1000µl CO\-RE tips.
	
	Using a wrong tip size may damage the pipetting channels!
	6. ‌Teaching Labware with the 1000µl\-Pipetting Channels‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	Teaching means:
	
	
		* Manually guiding a pipetting channel to a particular location on the deck with tools in the VENUS Software.
		* Assigning the name to the location
		* Instructing the ML STAR to “**remember**” it.  
	
	
	The precise position (the x\-y\-z coordinates) of labware items can be “**taught**” in this way, using the needle from the teaching station.
	
	Later, the only need is to specify the Lab ID and the STAR instrument instantly “**remembers**” exactly where it is positioned on the deck.
	
	The image below shows a teaching station on the waste block with all needles loaded.

	8
	
	
	
	1
	
	To teach the labware, only the 2nd needle is picked up by the pipetting channel. Make sure that at least this needle is loaded before activating the “**Move Probe**” Function.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (536\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	The teaching needles are optionally available and not part of the standard delivery package. They are also used in the maintenance methods.
	
	If the labware to teach is not on the deck, add it. To teach a labware position:
	
	
		1. By drag and drop, pre\-position the plate on the deck.
		2. The “**Adjust Labware Position**” Dialog will be displayed, as seen on the picture below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (537\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="506" height\="264">
		
		  
		
		
		
			* The **red colored well** (in the top row) indicates the “**first position**”.
			* The **gray colored well** (in the bottom row) indicates the “**last position**”.
			* Location: The default x/y/z\- coordinate is determined by the mouse\-cursor when dropping the labware onto the deck. Keep in mind that the Z\-Axis has an offset of 100mm
			* Rotation: The labware can be rotated and aligned as required. The rotation functions, the orientation of the labware can also be adjusted.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (538\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
	
	ATTENTION
	
	Before the pipetting channel with the teaching needle is moving from the waste block (picking up position) to the rough position of the labware, make sure there is no danger of collision with objects higher than 140 mm (from the deck surface).
	
	  
	
	
	Normally only the first position has to be taught. If the rows and columns of a chosen labware do not correspond to the x/y\-movements of the pipetting channels, there is a possibility to teach the first and the last position. This will allow compensating the slightest inaccuracy between the labware and the pipetting channel.
	
	The Move Probe Function
	
	
		1. Click on the **\[Move Probe]** and the following screen will be displayed.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (539\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="273">
		2. Select “**1000μl Channel**”
		3. The pipetting channel will be moved to the waste block to pick up the teaching needle. With the teaching needle, the instrument moves to the x/y\- coordinate of the position to be taught.
		4. The “**Move Probe – Key Control**” Dialog will appear.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (540\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="411" height\="272">
		5. As an alternative to step 2, select **\[Move to Position...]** from the “**Tools**” Menu.
		6. When **\[Cancel]** is clicked, the pipetting channel is lifted in Z\-direction first (to the traverse\- height) before moving to the waste block. At the waste block, the pipetting channel ejects the teaching needle. No new positions are stored.
		
		The keyboard (arrow keys, page up, page down) can guide the pipetting channel to the labware position. The step size is 1 mm per default. Use \+/\- keys to increase / decrease the step size.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (541\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
		
		ATTENTION
		
		Make sure that the chosen step size will not trigger a crash. The system can be seriously damaged when colliding with the pipetting channels. All collision control must be made by the user.
		7. The correct position is reached when the pipetting channel is at the bottom of the first or last well (corresponding with the red / gray position of the labware as seen in the picture of step 2\) of the labware. Prevent the pipetting channel from crashing the labware.

	ATTENTION
	
	Do not use **\[Move Probe]** in the simulation mode. The computer will try to establish a connection to an instrument several times otherwise will prompt a communication error after approximately 10 seconds.
	7. ‌Teaching Labware with 5ml\-Pipetting Channels‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	[Teaching Labware with the 5ml\-pipetting channels is very similar to teaching with 1000µl\-pipetting channels. The teaching needle is located on the waste block, in front of the waste bag for tips. Follow the same rules and instructions as given in the](#bookmark165) [Section 6\.6 Teaching Labware with](#bookmark165) the1000µl\- Channels.

	ATTENTION
	
	Before the pipetting channel with the teaching needle is moving from the waste block (picking up position) to the approximate position of the labware, make sure there is no danger of collision with objects higher than 140 mm (above the deck surface):
	8. ‌Teaching Labware with iSWAP‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	If the ML STAR is configured with an iSWAP, positions of the plates can be “**taught**” to it. In order to teach the position of the iSWAP, the labware which will handle is required.
	
	In the following example, a microplate carrier with at least one labware position is used.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (550\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	For the teaching process, the software requires a defined labware position. For this reason, at least one dummy position for the labware is required.
	
	Place the carrier with the labware to the instrument. In the software add the corresponding labware to the deck layout.
	
	  
	
	
	The following steps describe how to teach a position with the iSWAP is done:
	
	
		1. If the labware to teach is not on the deck, add it now.
		2. Using the “**Drag and Drop**” technique, pre\-position the labware on the deck.
		3. After dropping the labware onto the deck the window, as shown below will appear.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (551\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="506" height\="264">
		4. Clicking **\[Move Probe…]** will prompt the dialog shown below.
		5. Select “**iSWAP**” and click **\[OK]**

		ATTENTION
		
		If the iSWAP is moving with the plate to the approximate position, make sure that there is no danger of collision with other objects higher than 140 mm (above the deck surface).
		6. Click **\[OK]** to proceed. The “**Teaching with iSWAP**” Screen appears.
		7. In the “**Use labware from sequence**” Drop Down List, enter a sequence of a plate that is already in a valid position. Select the labware that the iSWAP has to pick\-up for the next steps of teaching. The default x/y\-coordinate “**Approximate target position**” is determined by the mouse\-cursor when dropping the labware to the deck.
		8. The iSWAP picks up the selected labware and moves to the x/y \- coordinate of the position to be taught.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (554\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="325" height\="338">
		9. The keyboard (arrow keys, page up, page down) can guide the iSWAP to the labware. The correct position is reached if the labware is touching the bottom of the transfer position. Prevent the iSWAP from crashing.
		10. Click **\[OK]** to proceed.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (555\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="329" height\="218">

	4. ‌How to use Templates‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	“**Templates**” offer a framework for commonly used method parts. This shortens the programming time immensely since the programmer does not have to start from scratch. Templates and sub\- method libraries within a method are treated similarly.
	
	A “**Templates**” or “**Toolbox Templates**” Tab is available. This is where the existing templates can be found.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (574\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="138" height\="123">
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (575\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Templates are not part of the basic installation of VENUS Software. They have to be added after the installation of VENUS Software.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Including Templates‌
		
		  
		
		
		Templates have to be stored in the folder **C:\\Program files**\\HAMILTON\\Library\\Templates (the non\-bold sections of the path may differ if a different language is in use).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (576\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		For the availability of templates, please consult a local Hamilton Representative.
		2. ### ‌Using Templates‌
		
		  
		
		
		After the templates have been copied to the …/HAMILTON/Library/Templates folder, they will now be visible in the “**Templates**” or “**Toolbox Templates**” Tab found in the Toolbox on the left side of the window when opening/creating a method.
		
		To use a template, drag it from the toolbox onto the method.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (577\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="364" height\="240">
		
		  
		
		
		[If a template is using parameters, the parameter window opens and can be filled (this is very similar to the use of sub\-methods / sub\-method libraries). Refer to](#bookmark199) [Section 9\.1 Sub\-Methods](#bookmark199) andSub\-Method Libraries.
		
		The example below shows the parameter window of the serial dilution template, where the instrument, sequences, volumes and the concentration have to be defined.

		If the template is fulfilling all requirements, no further changes are necessary. Finish the method programming.
		3. ### ‌Changing Templates‌
		
		  
		
		
		There are two ways to change a template:
		
		
			* Change an added template (in a method locally)
			* Change the template’s source file  
		
		
		Change an added Template (in a method locally)
		
		If the templates steps need modification, just click on the Template’s Tab in the method. This switches to the e.g. SerialDilution96\_1 steps. Here, all necessary changes can be made to completely fulfill all the requirements. For example, an aspiration of a sample can be modified with a mix step.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (580\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		Changes made in the method under the Template’s Tab are only valid for the particular template.
		
		  
		
		
		It is also possible to add the same template several times into the same method. This could be the case when e.g. two serial dilutions with different steps are needed in the same method. The templates include an index as a suffix (see below) as an indicator so that each template can be adapted according to the customer’s needs.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (581\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="329" height\="30">
		
		  
		
		
		Change a Template’s source file
		
		If a template should be changed to reduce the adaption work in every method, open the original Template file in the C:\\Program Files\\HAMILTON\\Library\\Templates folder. This folder is where the original Template files are stored. The Templates can be opened and modified from here. After applying the necessary changes, save the new version and open up a method to include the new version.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (582\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		To change a template globally, please open the file located in the C:\\Program Files\\HAMILTON\\Library\\Templates folder and change the original template. All following includes will then contain the changes made on the template.
		
		Changing an original template file will have no effect on the previously included templates. Only the newly added templates will contain the changes made in the original file.
	5. ‌Programming Templates‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	There are different ways to create a template.
	
	
		1. The easiest one is through the “File  New  Template Library” Menu.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (583\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="335" height\="233">
		2. Save the new template with a relevant name. Confirm with **\[Save]**.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (584\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="404" height\="262">
	6. ‌How to Edit an Existing Method‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	To edit an existing method:
	
	
		1. Use the Toolbar Icon to open an existing method. or
		2. From the “**File**” Menu, click Open.
		3. The “**Open**” Dialog appears where all method files of the current directory will be selectable.
		4. Once a selected method is opened, the Toolbox Window contains the "**General Steps**" and "**Local Sub\-Methods**", all other instrument\-dependent groups that may have been included (e.g. ML\_STAR, ML STAR Smart Steps) and application\-specific library groups (e.g. “**HSLTipCountingLib**” or “**HSLStrLib**”).
4. ‌How to Create a Sequence‌
=====


	1. ‌Sequence Editor‌
	--------
	
	  
	
	
	The sequence editor is part of the system deck editor. It is activated by clicking the “**Sequences**” Tab. With the sequence editor, the programmer declares series of cavities (containers) in an order in which they are processed by the instrument.
	
	Automatic Creation of a Sequence
	
	
		1. If a labware is added to the deck, a default sequence is generated automatically (as long as the ‘Generate default deck sequence’ checkbox is activated).
		2. The system checks which stamp tool is activated. The active stamp tool will be used for the sequence creation in the "**Stamp Tool**" Tab. To change the stamp tool, click the appropriate Probe Head Type.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (585\).gif" alt\="stamp" data\-size\="original" width\="258" height\="244">
		3. To enable the automatic sequence generation, click on the “**Labware**” Tab, used when adding labware. Tick the “**Generate default deck sequence**” Box as highlighted on the image below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (586\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="629" height\="172">
		4. Dependent to the active stamp tool, the automatic generated deck sequence on the new labware will be created.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (587\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="628" height\="166">
	
	  
	
	
	Creating a Sequence Manually
	
	Besides automatic created sequences, the Hamilton VENUS Software also allows the creation of sequences manually. This gives maximum flexibility and allows total control of the pipetting process. As a simple example, pipetting into every odd column of a plate shall be done. Instead of jumping around in an automatic sequence by only setting a current and end position, create a sequence that only contains all desired wells for the aspiration.
	
	  
	
	
	To create a new sequence, perform the following steps:
	
	
		1. Open the system deck and select the “**Sequences**” Tab.
		2. Click the **\[Clear Select]** Button to make sure no sequence is selected.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (588\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="186" height\="137">
		3. In the system deck window, select by clicking on the wells to add these labware positions to a sequence. The selected positions are highlighted in dark brown as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		Nun\_96\_Fl\_Lb\_000

  


1. Left click and do not release. Continue by moving over the desired positions, when the positions are covered by the rectangular parameter, release the button.

It is possible to use the rubber band action to add positions to a sequence. Please notice that the selected stamp tool will be used to sort the sequence when the rubber band action is being used.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (589\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

To select a labware position, click on it once. If a labware position is clicked the second time, it will be added to the sequence again.
2. Once all the positions belonging to a sequence have been selected, click the **\[Save as]** Button found on the upper left side of the window. A save dialog where the name for the sequence is specified will be prompted.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (590\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="371" height\="104">
3. Make sure to use relevant names such as “**TargetPlateOddColumns**” instead of “**MySequence1**”. Enter a name for the sequence and click **\[OK]**. The sequence is shown with the name in the “**Deck sequences**” List at the top center of the deck layout section, and the color changes from dark brown (draft sequence) to light brown (saved sequence).
4. In creating sequences on stacked labware (e.g. a stack of plates), select the Stack Z\-Height Order in the Stamp Tool box first. The sequence will then be sorted top\-down (descending) or bottom\-up (ascending), depending on the chosen sorting method.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (591\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="235" height\="189">

  


Checks

To envision the created sequence, select the sequence name from the “**Deck sequences**” List. The name of the sequence appears in blue, and the positions belonging to this sequence are highlighted in light brown.

1. To have the sequences checked by the system, click **\[Validate]** on the lower left side. A dialog will appear listing the invalid positions; otherwise it will state the following message: “**All sequences for this instrument are valid**”.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (592\).gif" alt\="checks" data\-size\="original" width\="295" height\="169">

or
2. Use the “**Play Sequence**” Function to see the sequence being processed. The “**Play**” Function is controlled by three buttons above the tabs in the upper half of the method editor screen. The **\[Play]** Button first deselects all positions in the sequence and then plays the sequence. As each position is selected, it is at the same time coated in the deck\-layout view and highlighted in the grid and tree views. Play can be paused at any time and can be resumed by clicking on the **\[Play]** Button again.

Advanced Sequence editing

To see all positions of a sequence in a list, double click the sequence or select the sequence and click **\[Advanced]** found on the left side of the “**Deck sequences**” List window. The position of the selected sequence will be displayed, as shown in the image below.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (597\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="370" height\="301">

The grid contains one row for each labware position in the sequence.

Editing positions

The “**Advanced**” Window offers several sorting options.

Sort by column

This allows sorting the sequence by LabwareID, PositionID, x, y and z. It is possible to specify up to three sorting options. Sorting will be executed as soon as the **\[Sort All]** Button is clicked.

Sort by direction

This allows sorting the whole sequence from top\-down or left\-right. Sorting will be executed as soon as the **\[Sort]** Button is clicked.

Apply Stamp Tool

This sorting option refers to the selected stamp tool in the stamp tool panel. When for example the “**Head 96**” stamp tool is activated, the sequence will be sorted to process the positions with the Head 96\.

*Delete Selected Positions* is used to delete one or more positions from the sequence. Click on the index (the number on the left side) of the position(s) to delete and click the **\[Delete Selected Positions]** Button.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (598\).gif" alt\="selecting positions" data\-size\="original" width\="175" height\="189">

The **\[CTRL]** Button can be used to select several specific positions in the sequence. All selected sequence positions are highlighted in the deck layout.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (599\).gif" alt\="selecting positions1a" data\-size\="original" width\="174" height\="228"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (600\).gif" alt\="selecting positions1b" data\-size\="original" width\="238" height\="163">

  


Saving the Sequence

Once the labware positions in the sequence are in the desired order, save the sequence by clicking the **\[Save as]** Button.

Saving affixes the order of each row in the grid as the order of the labware positions in the sequence. Upon saving, a prompt will request a name for the sequence.

Any existing sequence in the Deck Layout can be activated for viewing and/or editing by selecting the sequence name in the Drop\-Down Menu.

Additional labware positions can be inserted in the active sequence by selecting them in the Deck Layout View. Existing positions can be removed. Positions can be reordered as described above. The sequence can be resaved to fix its positions according to the new order.

  


1. ‌Stamp Tool‌
---

  


The “**Stamp Tool**[” Function allows applying the sequence positions to a labware depending on the pipetting tool being used: 1 to 16\-Pipetting Channels, CO\-RE 96 Probe Head, CO\-RE 384 Probe Head, CO\-RE 384 Probe Head STP (see](#bookmark369) [Section 12\.8 Method using the CO\-RE 384 Probe](#bookmark369) Head) and Nano Pipettor. The order is applied during the adding of labware onto the deck or when using the rubber band function to create new sequences.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (602\).gif" alt\="stamp tool single step" data\-size\="original" width\="270" height\="189">

The “**Single position**” Selection adds 1 position to the new sequence wherever the cursor is positioned and ticked (on a container).

2. ‌How to Create Sub\-Methods‌
=======


	1. ‌Sub\-Methods and Sub\-Method Libraries‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Parts of the existing methods can usually be re\-used at a later time in the same method or in other methods. The VENUS Software enables grouping of useful command routines that are called sub\- methods.
	
	Method 1

Sub\-method 2

Sub\-method 1

A local sub\-method is part of a particular method and remains linked to it. It is displayed along with the method it belongs to.

  


Method 2

Method 1

Submeth\-Lib 2

Submeth\-Lib 1

Submeth\-Lib 1

A **sub\-method library** contains an independent sub\-method that may be used in several independent methods. To make use of the advantages of sub\-methods, the functions of the “**Sub\- method**“ Library has to be included in a method.

  


Submeth\-Lib 2

Although sub methods and sub method libraries are different in terms of scope, the programming is very similar.

1. ‌How to Create Sub\-Methods‌


  



	1. In a method, right\-click in the top area beside the "**Main Method**" Tab / "**OnAbort**" Tab to open the Context Menu then click the **\[Add...]** Button to open a new dialog box where the interface of a sub\-method can be defined.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (605\).gif" alt\="right klick here" data\-size\="original" width\="270" height\="114">
	2. The “**Define Sub\-method**” Dialog, as shown below, will appear.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (606\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="478" height\="228">
	3. Specify a sub\-method name.
	
	The "**Visibility**" Option can only be used in sub\-method libraries. Such collection of steps may itself contain functions/procedures which will not be exported. In this case, they are of local nature and hence are not visible by the user of the library. Local sub\-methods will always be visible in the method within which they are defined.
	4. Enter a "**Sub\-method description**" to briefly describe its use. This entry is optional but helpful to other programmers who may access the method. Note that quotation marks are not required and should not be used in this field.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (607\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="518" height\="247">
	
	One or more parameters can be assigned to a sub\-method, to do this, perform the succeeding steps:
	5. Click **\[Add]** for each parameter to be assigned.
	6. For each parameter specify:
	
	
		* A name (which will be referenced throughout the sub\-method),
		* A type (variable, sequence, etc.) selected from the list in the drop\-down list available,
		* A direction (input, output or both)
		
		
			+ “**Direction**” refers to whether the variable used to call the sub\-method in the main method may be altered by the sub\-method or not.
			+ The “**Input**” Option means that the original variable is not to be altered.
			+ The “**Output**” Option means that the original variable will be overwritten by the sub\- method, and the value of the original variable cannot be used inside the sub\-method.
			+ The “**Both**” Option (both input and output) means that the original variable will be altered by the sub\-method.
	7. A short description of the parameter (without quotation marks).
	
	  
	
	
	Example:
	
	If the main method contains a variable par \= 10 and the sub\-method contains the operation par \= par \+ 5:
	
	
		* The “**Input**” yields the result 10 (the value of the parameter is copied from the main method and overwrites the value in the sub\-method)
		* The “**Output**” yields 5 (no value is read from the main method)
		* Then “**Both**” yield 15 (the value of the parameter is copied from the main method and is added to the operation in the sub\-method).
		
		To remove a parameter, click one of its description fields, and then click **\[Remove]**. To reorder parameters, select one and click **\[Move Up]** or **\[Move Down]**.
	8. Click **\[OK]** to store the sub\-method interface. The system returns to the previous window, and the new sub\-method is included in the “**Local Sub\-methods**” Tab found in the toolbox window.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (608\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="279" height\="133">
	9. Additional sub\-methods will be added to the “**Local Sub\-methods**” Tab. The main method itself is always on the first tab.  


Modifying a Sub\-Method

To modify an existing sub\-method (e.g. by adding or deleting steps), click on its tab in the method window and it will open for editing.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (609\).gif" alt\="sub\-methode" data\-size\="original" width\="208" height\="78">

  


Variables in Sub\-Methods

[Just like in a method, variables can be created in a sub\-method. However, unlike those in a method, sub\-method variables remain local (see](#bookmark283) Section 11\.1 Variables and Return Values).

  


Promoting Variables to Global Status

A local variable defined inside a sub\-method can be promoted to global status if it has to be used elsewhere.

From the Menu, select “Methods” and choose “Export Local Variables…”. A dialog will prompt containing a list box that displays the local variables in the current sub\-method.


	1. Tick the box of all variables that will be promoted to global status.
	2. Click **\[Export]** to promote the variables globally.

2. ‌Sub\-Method OnAbort‌
--

  


The “**OnAbort**” Sub\-method appears in every method. This sub\-method is used to execute steps in case of an (instrument\- or user caused) abort. It can contain indicated to do instructions when the method is aborted. If a method finishes successfully, the steps in the OnAbort sub method are not executed.

2. ‌How to Create Labware Files‌
========

If the labware is not pre\-defined, custom racks and containers can be defined using the Labware Editor. The custom labware can be used like any other pre\-defined labware object from the library. A labware object is a representation of the real physical labware.

To define the new labware:


	1. Select “Tools  Labware  Labware Editor …” in the Method Editor, or the “Define Labware” Icon found on the toolbar:

	2. The Labware Editor with an empty main window will be activated.
	3. To create a new labware, select “File  New“ from the Labware Editor Menu. The sub\-menu offers five choices, which are the different types of labware. This will be explained in the succeeding sub\-sections.  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (614\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="385" height\="224">


	1. ‌Defining a Labware‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	The following section illustrates the procedures for defining a labware using the example of a rectangular rack. The first step of each labware definition is to describe the geometry of a single container. The second step is by putting several containers together which creates an overall labware (e.g. tube).
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Defining a Container‌
		
		  
		
		
		A completed container can then be used in a rack definition.
		
		
			1. Select “File  New  Container“ from the Labware Editor Menu.
			2. Define the container as a round\-bottomed tube with an outer diameter of 10 mm, with a total container length of 75 mm and a material thickness of 0\.5 mm.
			3. Indicate the number of container segments as “2” because the tube has a cylindrical segment and a round\-bottomed segment.
			4. Remember that the Base Point for all further references is the inside bottom point.
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (615\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="214" height\="195">
			
			10
			
			  
			
			
			Segm. 1
			
			Base point 75
			
			Segm. 2
			
			0\.5
			5. Set the clearance height at 80 mm (75 mm for the container length plus additional 5 mm for the traveling); measured from the container inner base (Base Point). The clearance height is the height at which the pipetting arm can pass over the container without touching it.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (616\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="98" height\="257">
			
			Clearence height
			6. Set the maximum pipetting height (minimum height above tube bottom) counted from the container bottom to 4 mm. This allows the tip to go down to a position of 4 mm above the tube bottom (this gives the “**Dead Volume**”).
			7. Click the checkbox for Liquid Level Detection, to mark it.
			8. With the assumption that the last 7 mm will not contain any liquid and with some additional LLD space (here 2\.5 mm) the liquid seeking height is 70 mm.
			
			An information will be prompted when an unexpected LLD is found.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (617\).gif" alt\="C:\\Users\\cweber\\Desktop\\Capture.PNG" data\-size\="original" width\="303" height\="255">
			9. Set the “**touch\-off at bottom height**” to 0 mm.
			10. “**Touch\-off at bottom height**” is the position of the tip when dispensing with “**touch off**” into an empty container.
			11. If a side touch dispensing on the container is not wanted, leave the “**wick side of container**” checkbox unmarked.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (618\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="263" height\="282">
			
			  
			
			
			A **Side Touch Dispense** is a special dispense mode to prevent droplets on the tips end.
			12. The tip will move in the center of the container to the specific touch off height. From there, a Right move is performed. Then, the liquid will be dispensed and the tip or needle moves up and away.

		2. ### ‌Defining a Rectangular Rack‌
		
		  
		
		
		For ease of use, in defining a rack for the containers, ensure that all racks and containers defined have clear and distinct names.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (629\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="309" height\="196">
		
		  
		
		
		
			1. Select “New  Rectangular Rack” from the File Menu in the Labware Editor. A series of dialog boxes will appear allowing the programmer to design the rack.
			
			  
			
			
			
				* Always choose “**Regular rectangular rack**” to define or modify rectangular racks and microplates. Choosing “**Microplate**” requests only a subset of the information relevant for the ML STAR.
				* If defining the cover is intended, check the “**Include cover definition**” Option.
				* Activate one of the “**Visible by default**” Options.
				* Click the “**Background Color**” Box to select a background color of preference.
				* Type a name and a description for the new rack in the corresponding data fields.
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (630\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="263" height\="299">
			2. Click **\[Next \>]**. The image shown below will only be included in the wizard settings if the “**Include Cover Definition**” Box has been ticked in the previous step.
			3. To define the rack cover, specify the following:
			
			
				* “**Covered Rack Stack Height**”, i.e. the stack height if covers without racks are stacked
				* Distance from “**Rack base to Cover Base**”
				* “**Stack Height**”, if racks with covers are stacked
				* “**Thickness of Cover**” (in Z\-dimension)
				* Cover “**Dimensions**” in x, y, and z
				* A cover name and description and select an icon for the graphical representation of the cover, if one exists
				
				If the cover shall appear in a labware category, use the “**Assign Labware Categories**” Tab.
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (631\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="299">
			4. To return to the previous step, simply click on the **\[\< Back]** Button. To proceed click **\[Next \>].** A dialog for the definition of the rack shape in the x\- and y\-dimension will prompt.
			5. For the x\- and y\-axes, click **\[Insert Segment]**, to add the segments where the rack belongs.
			6. Specify the dimensions of each segment in mm as shown below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (632\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="263" height\="299">

			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (633\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="195" height\="139">
			8. After doing so, a new wizard will display, still requiring values.
			9. In this dialog, key in the following:
			
			
				* Number of rows (number of containers in y\-direction)
				* Number of containers or holes per row (in x\-direction)
				* Hole inner diameter for display in the Deck Layout
				* Rack height (total height of the plate)
				* Rack clearance height (clearance from rack base where pipetting channels can travel safely)
				* Stack height (when multiple racks are stacked  height of one rack)
				* Dimensions for clearance height (safe travel height for tips/heads/tools) and stacking height. The difference between these two parameters is shown in the following sketch.
				* Tick “**Load Rack with Containers**”.
				* Give the overall clearance height of the assembly (here 100 mm).
				* If there is a rack that cannot be stacked, leave a value of 0 mm in the field “**Stack height**”. Otherwise, measure or calculate the height. The image shown after the dialog box illustrates how to measure the height.

				Clearance height Stack height
				* Tick “**Include Rack Boundary**”, to allow the boundaries to be set in one of the next steps.
			10. Click **\[Next \>]**, to get the “**Rectangular Rack Measurements**” Dialog box shown below.
			11. Enter the distance between the holes in:
			
			
				* x\-direction (distance between the holes), in this example it is set at 9 mm
				* y\-direction (distance between the rows), in this example it is set at 9 mm
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (637\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="299">
			12. Click **\[Next \>]** to proceed to the indexing dialog.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (638\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="299">
			
			The default indexing parameters are set as used in the Microplate but with alphanumeric numbering instead of simple indexing. This can be selected or changed, depending on the application.
			13. After specifying the correct settings, click **\[Next \>]**. The dialog for the Boundary Measurements appears.
			14. ‌The dialog below defines the following:
			
			
				* Adjacent boundaries of the center of the hole with the lowest (bottom\-left\-most) x\- and y\- coordinates,
				* Width and length of the rack (e.g. the outline of a microplate)
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (639\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="299">
			15. The rack definition has been completed. Since the “**Load the Rack with Containers**” is checked in step 8, the containers which will be placed in the holes of the rack can be defined too.
			16. Click **\[Next \>]**, to continue with the “**Container Type**” Definition.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (640\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="239" height\="271">
			17. In this dialog, either browse the directories for already\-defined containers (extension “**.ctr**”) to fill the new rack with or click **\[New]** [to define a new container as described in](#bookmark212) [Section](#bookmark212) 10\.1\.1Defining a Container.
			
			
				* Tick the "**Rack is regular**" Option to add a single container type to all positions in the rack or to add different container types to positions in the rack, deactivate the "**Rack is regular**" Option and click on the **\[Containers with Offset…]** Button instead.
				* Tick the “**Containers are connected**” Setting, if there are virtual containers which are physically in one container. Virtual or Individual containers are required to position each probe or pipetting channel correctly within a single large container and to have the correct follow and volume calculations.
				* Enter the distance from the bottom of the rack to the bottom of the selected container. Remember to add in the thickness of the container bottom for calculations regarding the container’s “**reference point**”.
			18. To handle the offsets for each container, click **\[Containers with Offset]**. All the containers with their offsets are listed in a table as presented below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (641\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (642\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="540" height\="416">
			19. Select one or more positions and click on **\[Position Properties…]**. Note that all selected rows will be updated with the set of values from the table.
			
			
				* Optional container offset (x, y): The default position for any container is the ‘center’ of the container. This will be the calculated coordinate used at runtime (usually by a probe or tip).
				
				  
				
				
				Example: To change the calculated position of a container, provide the offset values of x and y from the actual center of the container. Enter a distance of 3 mm ‘to the right of container center’.

		Fine\-Tune Positions
		
		A fine\-tune of the positions of any container can be done. To do so, follow these steps:
		
		
			1. Select “Edit  Definition...” in the File Menu of the Labware Editor.
			2. Click through all dialogs boxes until the last by clicking **\[Next \>]**.
			3. In the “**Container type**” Dialog, a table displaying all containers with their corresponding number (defined in the “**Indexes**” Dialog) and the common base offset will be shown.
			4. [Move each container in any direction: x, y or z (see](#bookmark214) [Step 14 for creating a container,](#bookmark214) Section10\.1\.2 Defining a Rectangular Rack).
			5. If everything is correct, click **\[OK]** to exit and **\[Finish]** to return to the Labware Editor.
			6. Select “**Exit**” in the File Menu of the Labware Editor.
			7. Once back in the Deck Layout Editor window, place the newly\-designed rack on the deck by clicking the “**Labware**” Tab, clicking “**Browse**” and selecting the rack in the file selection box. The rack will be displayed in a graphical representation and can be dragged and dropped onto the deck.
	2. ‌Defining a Carrier (Template)‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	Carriers are placed onto the ML STAR deck. They have sites for labware, such as plates, troughs or tubes. A carrier files is defined as a template (\*.tpl).
	
	In the following a carrier that is pre\-loaded with flat 96\-well Nunc microplates is defined.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (646\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	A Tube Carrier in the sense of labware is not a carrier (template). It is a rack which directly fits the track geometry of the Microlab STAR and therefore can directly be loaded onto the instrument deck.
	
	  
	
	
	To define a Carrier:
	
	
		1. Open the Labware Editor and select “File  New  Template”.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (647\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="300" height\="190">
		2. The “**Template Definition**” Dialog opens.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (648\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="317" height\="329">
		
		
			* The “**Width**” of the carrier is derived from:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (649\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="36" height\="1">
			
			*width* \[*mm*] \= \# \[*track* ] ⋅ 22\.5 \[
			
			mm track ]
			* In the case of a plate carrier which is 6 tracks wide, the result is 136 mm. The length of a ML STAR track is always 497 mm.
			* Select the “**Pre\-loaded**” Checkbox, to let the carrier be pre\-loaded with the microplates. Select a background color of choice.
			* Type a name and a description for the carrier.
			* Select a picture file (if available) for the graphical representation of the carrier in the method editor. Click **\[Next \>]**.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (650\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
			
			ATTENTION
			
			The clearance height defines – the traverse height at which the pipetting channels can move without collision.
			
			Clearance height should not exceed 140mm.
			
			Wrong clearance height definitions can lead to serious damages.
		3. In the next window, the sites hosting the plates have to be defined:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (651\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="478" height\="105">
		4. Select the lines, one after another or several together and click on **\[Site Properties…]**.
		5. A new dialog box as shown below opens.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (652\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="380" height\="316">
		6. All selected sites will be updated with the values from this dialog.
		
		
			* “**Drawing**” is only of visual relevance; accept the defaults.
			* For “**Snap to site**”, select the lower option for a microplate, because a microplate fits with its bottom onto the plate carrier, to enable a good electrical coupling for capacitance\-based LLD.
			* All plate types should be defined with the same ‘footprint’ of 127 x 86mm. Only this size will snap onto a default carrier.
			* Click on **\[Browse]** to search for the corresponding labware to add pre\-defined or user\- defined labware to the site.
			* To define a new labware site to be added on the deck, click **\[New...]**. This starts the “**Rectangular Rack Definition**” Wizard as described previously.
		7. After filling out all “**Site Properties**” Fields, click **\[OK]**.
		8. Save the new carrier within the Labware Editor (e.g. as “**MyCarrier**” (**.tml**)). The sketch below illustrates the different “**Origin**” coordinates and “**Dimensions**”.
		9. Click “File  Exit”, to exit the Labware Editor and switch back to the Deck Layout Editor and position the carrier on the deck:
		
		The carrier is now pre\-loaded with a plate and the custom rack (sites) on top. The carrier itself without any pre\-loaded items can be loaded onto the Deck Layout.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (653\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="101" height\="227">

		Site
		
		Site origin y\-offset
		
		  
		
		
		  
		
		
		Width
		
		Site origin x\-offset
		
		  
		
		
		The decision whether a plate (or tip rack) fits in a site of a carrier is made depending on the length and width of the site: all plates that have the same boundary measures (length 86 mm, width 127 mm) can be placed on the site.
		10. Open the newly defined carrier in the Labware Editor.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (654\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="425" height\="223">
		11. Select “Edit  Properties...”. A dialog will prompt.

	NOTE
	
	Always start with the given settings of a standard carrier and the apply changes in a step by step manner. Do not change the properties names or their spelling. These names are system properties.
	3. ‌Labware Categories‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	To be able to group the labware in the selection tree of the System Deck Editor, each labware has to be assigned to a labware category first. For the labware that comes with the default installation, this has been done already.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (658\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="211" height\="109">
	
	  
	
	
	However, in creating an own new labware, connection should be done manually.
	
	
		1. Open the Labware Editor where the rack or template has been created.
		2. Choose the category where the rack or template will be linked to and click **\[Assigned Category]**.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (659\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="191" height\="322">
		3. The category is displayed in the “Assigned Labware Category” Field shown in the image above. Assigning a labware for more than one category can be done. For instance, a 96\-well Deep Well Plate can be in the category “Plates  96 Position Plates” and in the “Deep Well Plates” Category.
		4. In order to apply the changes into the software, update the labware category index. Select “**Generate Labware Category Index**” in the Labware Editor, as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (660\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="232" height\="263">
		5. A message box will indicate the successful update of the index.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (661\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="179" height\="116">
		6. If an appropriate category for the labware cannot be found, create a new labware category.
		7. To do so, select “**Labware Categories**” in the Labware Editor.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (662\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="233" height\="277">
		8. The screen below will appear.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (663\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="228" height\="264">
		9. Click on **\[New Category]**. After entering a new category name, click **\[OK]**.
	4. ‌Labware Properties‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	Within the labware, some flags and settings (labware properties) are defined to determine handling of the labware elements. Labware properties should not be changed by the user although they are accessible.
	
	These properties can be divided up into the following groups:
	
	
		* Information for the handling with the Autoload unit
		* Information for the accessories like tip handling, waste, etc.
		* Information to support the reduction of selection during edit time.Structure
	
	The properties always combine a key name and a value. The key names are case\-sensitive. All values are in integers (no decimal points).
	
	To find the following tables, right click an easy step and select “**what’s this**”. Click “**miscellaneous**” to expand and finally choose “**Definion of labware properties**”.

3. ‌Advanced Programming‌
=


	1. ‌Variables and Return Values‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Variables‌
		
		  
		
		
		Within a method, the programmer will naturally define and process variables. There are two ways to specify variables:
		
		
			1. Use the “**Assignment / Assignment with calculation steps**” from the “**General Steps**”.
			2. Type in the variable and the value needed and confirm with **\[OK]**.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (734\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="420" height\="142">
			3. Activate the “Variables and Constants” Screen shown below in the “View  Variables” Menu or with \[ALT \+ F7].
			4. To create a new variable, trigger the Context Menu with a right click in the Variables and Constants scree, and select “**New**”.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (735\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="409" height\="252">
			5. Type in the name, type, scope, start value and the description (optional). Confirm the entries with **\[OK]**.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (736\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="341">
			6. The new variable is now available in the method.
			
			  
			
			
			The method editor supports three kinds of variables with differing scope:
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Local variables: | Valid only within a sub\-method. All variables declared inside a sub\-method automatically have a local scope. Local variables can be promoted to “Task local variables” through the “Method Export local variable” Menu. |
			| --- | --- |
			| Task local variables: | Valid within a method. All sub\-methods have access to variables of this type. Local variables and Task local variables with identical names can coexist however, it is recommended to use naming conventions or prefixes. Such variables are generated when they are declared within the main program, or for example, within the method. When the method is scheduled, each task will have its own task local variable. |
			| Global variables: | Can be accessed by all tasks using a method (see the Scheduler Manual). They can be declared in the Method Editor through the “**Method**  **Global variables**” Menu. This menu option can also promote a Task local variable to a global variable.If a workflow contains a task local variable and a global variable with thesame name, a name conflict occurs. In this case, a syntax error hint will be signaled. |

			NOTE
			
			It is important to avoid mixing and confusing local and global variables. If possible, use naming conventions allowing the identification of each variable type:
			
			GV*\_\<variable name\> for global variables used for all tasks of the same method*
			
			TV*\_\<variable name\> for task local variables used in one method*
			
			LV*\_\<variable name\> for local variables used in a sub\-method*
			
			It is not possible to define variables which are valid in a method without being also valid in the related sub\-methods. For this requirement, define task local variables with reserved names, e.g.:
			
			MLV*\_\<variable name\> for local variables used in a method.*
			
			  
			
			
			The Graphical Method Editor provides variables which can accommodate three sub\-types of variables without explicit declaration:
			
			
				* Integers (numbers)
				* Floats (floating point numbers)
				* Strings (text variables and characters)
				
				Variables can be newly defined within the dialogs, if they occur in the following:
				* Left\-hand side of an equation (e.g. x\=0, or x\=t\+1\), or
				* Within entry fields that hold only one variableIf not requested (as it is the case for the “**Open File**” Dialog), the variable types are identified automatically. For example, f\=5 will generate a variable f of type integer.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (738\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			To define a string (text) variable through the assignment step, the text must be enclosed in quotation marks, e.g. **“s”** \= “**Test**”. The variable **“s”** is then of type string. Otherwise, the contents of a variable named “**Test**” and its contents will be assigned to s. If the “**Test**” variable does not exist, a warning will be prompted.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (739\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="386" height\="196">
			
			Variables once defined show up in the drop\-down list of all input fields of a method. Syntax
			
			For variable names, **do not**
			
			− place numbers at the beginning
			
			− use blanks or signs other than the underscore (“\_”) Variable names are case\-sensitive.
			
			To define a path within a string variable in the course of programming, use the double backslash (“**\\\\**”) \- e.g. “c:\\\\programfiles\\\\hamilton\\\\methods\\\\“. To define a path at run time by typing it into an input box, use single backslash (“**\\**“). The reason for this is that variables defined in the course of programming are analyzed for escape sequences (for example single backslash “**\\**”), and single backslash followed by n (“**\\n**“) means “**new line**”.
		2. ### ‌Return Values‌
		
		  
		
		
		Often times, the steps used will return data when the step is executed. A typical example would be a mathematical function, like a simple assignment x\=0\.
		
		Dialog functions or instrument steps can also return data:
		
		
			* Dialog functions will provide a code of the button pressed upon exit enabling the method to continue depending on the button pressed in a particular dialog.
			* Instrument steps can, for example, return a temperature for the TCC (Temperature\- Controlled Carrier) or a pressure value for the BVS / CVS.  
		
		
		Example 1 (Function Call)
		
		Using the "**Round**" Function of the HLSMth library leads to the dialog below showing an entry field "**Bind return value to:**" which by default is empty. Select a variable listed in the dropdown list or enter a variable name, even one that does not yet exist. Leaving this field empty means that there is no variable where the rounded value of *NumberOfCycles\_Float* will be taken from.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (740\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="418" height\="259">
		
		Example 2 (Instrument Step Return Values)
		
		In a similar way you can have access to the additional return value of, for example, the "**GetTemperature**" Function of the TCC. Some functions return more than one item of information.
		
		If you use this "**GetTemperature**" Function, you will only be asked for the TCC you want to use. The value of interest, the returned temperature, needs to be bound in a separate task.
		
		To do this perform these steps:
		
		
			1. Right\-click on the desired step.
			2. Select "**Bind Return values...**" from the Context Menu that opens.  
		
		
		
		
		| <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (741\).jpg" alt\="þÿ" data\-size\="original" width\="196" height\="329"> | The “**Bind Return values…**” Function is also available as a function button in the toolbar. The function is active for method steps which have additional return values. |
		| --- | --- |
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (742\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The “**Easy Steps**” and “**Smart Steps**” do not have the “**Bind Return values…**” Function.
		
		  
		
		
		These pieces of information as presented in the image below can be stored in variables for further processing or to be used as output. The dialog generally lists the return values, each with an editable field “**Variable Name**”, to define the variable the return value is to bound to.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (743\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="338" height\="183">
		3. ### ‌When to Bind Variables‌
		
		  
		
		
		It is up to the programmer to choose whether to bind variables or not. Often times, the variables need to be handled in a different way from what are shown in the examples. For user defined error handling, there is a necessity to bind return values.
		
		Functions with additional return values which have to be bound by the procedure, as shown above can be simply recognized in a method. The number of return values is given, even if it is not going to be handled (see in the topmost label of method 2, "**Tip Pick Up**" in the image below). The return value(s) assigned to the variables will also be shown (see the method Steps 3 and 4 in the image below).

	2. ‌Customized Dialog‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	What is the Custom Dialog Step?
	
	The custom dialog step allows creating user dialogs that contain multiple and different input controls such as Drop\-Down Lists, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Text Input Controls, File Browse Controls, Numeric Input Controls, Pictures, Buttons and Text Blocks. All these controls can be arranged in any desired way.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (745\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="215" height\="220">
	
	  
	
	
	The custom dialog step is located in a separate "**Custom Dialog Steps**" Tab.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (746\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="298" height\="73">
	
	After a “Drag and Drop” to the method, the selection for templates is shown.
	
	Choose either blank or User Output: 1 Button, User Output: 2 Buttons or User Output: 3 Buttons to start with a predefined dialog that contains already some buttons.
	
	After this selection, the editor starts (In this example: User Output: 2 Buttons)
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (747\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="548" height\="354">
	
	  
	
	
	Step 1: Add controls to the custom dialog
	
	Customize the dialog box by adding basic controls and input controls from the toolboxes located on the left of the window. The elements can be added through a simple “Drag and Drop”. It is then possible to arrange the elements added into the dialog. The dialog itself can be adjusted in size.
	
	  
	
	
	Step 2: Adjust the Properties of the Added Elements
	
	To make changes on an element, simply select the element and choose ‘Properties’. Depending on the type of the element, the appearance, the behavior, and the font can be adjusted. All elements contain ‘General’ properties that are used to specify the variable binding and containing the handler of the element which is the ControlID. This ID is used to link events to the elements and makes the dialog ‘intelligent’.
	
	  
	
	
	Step 3: Add Intelligence to the Custom Dialog
	
	Using the ‘Events’ on the custom dialog can make the dialog intelligent. That means that specified elements of the dialog are only shown if e.g. a checkbox of another element is set. To understand further, see the example to below.
	
	Example:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (748\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="295" height\="142">
	
	  
	
	
	The details of the ‚Preparation method’ are only visible if the according checkbox is activated. If deactivated, the user cannot make errorous inputs and is not confused by an overloaded dialog.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (749\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="293" height\="136">
	
	  
	
	
	Getting Help for the Custom Dialog
	
	Available in the help of the dialog are the explanations about the following:
	
	
		* how to link variables
		* handle events on elements and
		* change the behavior at runtimeSimply click on the **\[Help]** Button on the bottom right corner. This will open the “**Custom Dialog Overview**”, where a simple click on the desired area will activate the related help section.

	3. ‌Dispense on the Fly‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	VENUS Software offers a dispense on the fly (Single Step). This step does not stop the x\- movement while pipetting which allows a very fast dispensing of liquid, e.g. to fill a plate with reagent.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (751\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
	
	ATTENTION
	
	This feature is available for 1000µl\-pipetting channels and for 5ml\-pipetting channels.
	
	  
	
	
	Refer to the dialog box shown below while reading this section. The following parameters of the dialog box must be filled.
	
	Sequence
	
	The sequence positions where to dispense the previously aspirated liquid.
	
	Sequence Counting
	
	Select “**Automatic**” to update the current position of the sequence or choose “**Manually**” to not adjust the current position of the sequence.
	
	Volume
	
	The volume that shall be dispensed per well. Note: The volume per pipetting channel is constant.
	
	Dispense on the Fly Mode
	
	Complete plate will sort the sequence accordingly.
	
	Sequence order uses a sorted sequence (must fit to the selected pipetting channel pattern).
	
	Labware Surface Distance
	
	The position above the labware surface where the liquid is dispensed (travelling height).
	
	X\-Speed During Dispense
	
	This value specifies the x\-move speed. This value is dependent on the volume to be dispensed, the flow rate in the liquid class and the distance between the wells.
	
	Start X\-Offset
	
	The dispense normally starts in the center of the well. For larger volumes, shift the start point to the left to make sure the full volume is dispensed into the well.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (752\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="425" height\="312">

	In the Advanced section, the following parameters can be changed. Please refer to the image below whil reading this section.
	
	Liquid Class
	
	It is possible to use a different liquid class than in the aspirations step
	
	X\-Acceleration Distance Before First Shoot
	
	The distance at which speed for pipetting should be reached (see graphic above).
	
	Dispense Direction
	
	Choose “**Serpentine**” (for quick dispense) or “**From left only**”
	
	Exclude Labware Positions
	
	This option allows to not dispense to specified positions.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (754\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="317" height\="355">
	
	  
	
	
	Example: A1 / B1 must be left empty since it is a blank position on the reader plate.
	
	Add a separate dispense step after dispense on the fly, using the dispense mode ‘Drain tip in jet mode’ to dispense the rest of the volume out of the tip.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (755\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Make sure that the liquid class in the aspiration is set to DispenseJet Part Volume, otherwise the “**Dispense on the Fly**” Step will show an error.
	
	Run some tests on the instrument to properly adjust the x\-speed during dispense. Set the value to “**0**” to let VENUS calculate the x\-speed.
	
	The x\-speed during dispense depends on the volume, the liquid class parameters and the labware geometry.

	4. ‌Arrays in Steps‌
	--------
	
	  
	
	
	Arrays can be used in steps, for example in fields like “**Sequence**”, “**Volume**” and “**LC**”. The existing arrays are listed together with the variables in the drop down list. Once an array has been selected, the **\[Array Index Dialog]** Button is displayed next to the data field containing the array (see green arrow).
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (758\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="363" height\="179">
	
	  
	
	
	Clicking the button opens the “**Array Index Dialog**” as shown below.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (759\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="270" height\="260">
	
	In this dialog, the following options can be selected:
	
	Use Single Array Value:
	
	Enter the index of the specific array element (a digit or a variable). This selection is disabled when only a series of elements is allowed.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (760\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="298" height\="174">
	
	  
	
	
	Use Multiple Array Values:
	
	Enter an array start index, to select a series of array elements. For example in the field of an aspiration step, to set the individual volumes per pipetting channel, starting at a specific index (see picture below).
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (761\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="299" height\="210">
	
	  
	
	
	
		* Activate automatic array index selection. This function is available for arrays of well\-defined functions, where the usage of the array index is specified precisely. For example, a smart step processing some well\-defined positions uses an array with all the volumes of the individual positions. In this case, the step needs only the array without index, because the index is, for example, defined by the currently processed position.
	5. ‌1000µl\-Pipetting Channels versus 5ml\-Pipetting Channels‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Working with the 5ml\-pipetting channel on the ML STAR is almost the same as working with 1000 µl\-pipetting channels. The same CO\-RE technology (in a different size) is used to pick up tips and tools, cLLD and pLLD can be performed and the same pipetting features (TADM, MAD, ADC) as on the 1000µl\-pipetting channels are available on the 5ml\-pipetting channels.
	
	However, although the familiar appearance of the Single Steps and Easy Steps for the 5ml\- pipetting channel are kept the same, there are some differences to keep in mind when working with the 5ml\-pipetting channel.
	
	Pipetting: 5ml\-Pipetting Channel Pattern
	
	Due to its large capacity, the 5ml\-pipetting channel needs more space on the y\-rail. Therefore, the closest distance from one tip end to the neighbor tip end is 18 mm (this is true if the pipetting channels are mounted on a double rail arm. On a single rail arm, the distance is 36 mm). This has an influence on the sequence, for example, on plates.
	
	Using the stamp tool for the 5ml\-pipetting channel, a sequence on a plate will look like this:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (762\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="482" height\="115">
	
	  
	
	
	This means that four 5ml\-pipetting channels can work in parallel on a landscape plate.
	
	  
	
	
	Pipetting: Well / Tube Diameter
	
	Depending of the immersion depth, the 5ml\-pipetting channel may collide with well or tube walls. See image guide below for useable diameters and heights to avoid hardware crashes.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (763\).jpg" alt\="ep" data\-size\="original" width\="323" height\="203"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (764\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="188" height\="303">
	6. ‌Tip Handling Details‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	This section discusses essential tip handling topics. Although the process of tip handling is stable and safe, some precautions must be considered when handling with special labware.
	
	VENUS Software offers a tip recognition feature based on the different tip geometries. It is available for both disposables and needles and it is activated during installation by a Service Engineer. This feature increases the ML STAR instrument´s security, especially when different tip types (e.g. low\- and standard volume tips) are used. In addition, all tip racks have color\-coded labels and are bar\-coded to be identified by the Autoload option (if installed).
	
	For distinguishing disposable CO\-RE tips, 50µl and CO\-RE tips and 300µl, a special library is needed. Please consult a local Hamilton Representative.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (765\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="51" height\="51">
	
	NOTE
	
	All new or special tip types require additional settings (such as configuration file entries, liquid classes etc.) in the VENUS Software. Please consult a local Hamilton Representative for the implementation data of non\-standard tips.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Tip Recognition with Different Tip Types on the Same Deck Layout‌
		
		  
		
		
		The tips used in a pipetting procedure must match with the suitable pipetting channel or pipetting head in order to prevent damage to the device. Proper precautions have to be taken when loading tips in order to prevent confusing with the tips or loading wrong tip types.
		
		Whenever possible, use ***loading with Autoload*** and make sure that only tip carriers with the suffix …BC… (e.g. TIP\_CAR\_480BC\_ST\_A00\) are used. In case of a wrong tip rack, the system, while loading will prompt an error which looks like the image shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (766\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="374" height\="323">
		
		When using another tip carrier (e.g. the 50 µl tip carrier) switch to the Deck Layout and change the properties MlStarCarBCOrientation to 1 and the MlStarCarNoReadBarcode to 0\.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (767\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="201"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (768\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="201">
		
		  
		
		
		When ***loading manually***, pay extra attention to the tip types which are similar in design and cannot be distinguished by the tip recognition feature. When CO\-RE tips, 1\-50µl and CO\-RE tips, 10\-300µl are used on the same Deck Layout, a ***special library*** is needed. Please consult a local Hamilton Representative. In addition, check the label of the tip rack. The volume of the tips can be found on the top left corner of the barcode label:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (769\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="514" height\="127">
		
		  
		
		
		When ***loading manually*** and there is ***no library available*** for distinguishing the different tip types used, ***visual inspection*** of the barcode label is the only option. This is the case for Slim Tips, 10\- 300µl used in combination with CO\-RE Tips, 10\-1000µl.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (770\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="51" height\="51">
		
		NOTE
		
		Slim tips and 1000µl tips have the same head sizes therefore it can only be checked through the barcode reader.
		2. ### ‌Rocket Tips‌
		
		  
		
		
		It is possible to use Rocket Tips to pipette larger volumes than 50 µl using the CO\-RE 384 Head. Rocket Tips combine a 300 µl tip body with a 4\-channel head adapter.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (771\).png" alt\="Rocket\_Tip" data\-size\="original" width\="293" height\="153"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (772\).jpg" alt\="TipRack\_RocketTips" data\-size\="original" width\="182" height\="145">
		
		  
		
		
		To use the advantages of the Rocket Tips, the following settings have to be considered:
		
		
			* Use the tip mode: (1\) 96 Tips / Rocket Tips in all the steps  [See](#bookmark294) [NOTE](#bookmark294)
			* Set the tip type to 300 µl Rocket Tip (96\) for 384
			* Use a Rocket Tip Liquid Class
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (773\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="307" height\="319">
			
			  
			
			
			To pick up only single row(s), column(s) or a quarter:
			* Use the reduced pattern mode: (1\) Tips / Rocket tips in all the steps  [See](#bookmark294) [NOTE](#bookmark294)
			* Click the “**Customize**” Tab and select “**Channel settings**”
			* Select all, one channel, quarter, row(s) or column(s), depending on the pattern that shall be used.
			
			‌The picture below shows the head (**not the plate**) and which tips will be picked up.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (774\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="179">
			
			  
			
			
			The following is an example on how the head will be located over the plate if the plate sequence is sorted accordingly.

			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (776\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			‌NOTE
			
			Rocket tips can only be used on the 50 µl CO\-RE 384 Probe Head. The reduced pattern mode has to be set in all pipetting steps.

		3. ### ‌Tip Pick\-up with the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head‌
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (777\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="306" height\="198">
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (778\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="306" height\="211">
		
		The multiprobe heads need more space to pick up tips than the single pipetting channels. Therefore, it is important to use an appropriate Deck Layout. This will avoid collisions at run time.
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		| Example:Picking up tips with the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head out of e.g. the Nestable Tip Rack (NTR) will not work in the lower positions, if a high plate carrier, a wash station etc. is placed **directly beside** the tip carrier. |
		| --- |
		| Solution:Leave a space of **one track** to the left and to the right of the tip carrier  See white lines.The multiprobe heads are now able to pick up tips without collision with other carriers. |
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (779\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The same precautions have to be taken with all tip racks for the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head / CO\-RE 384 Probe Head and the single pipetting channels.
		4. ### ‌Nestable Tip Rack (NTR)‌
		
		  
		
		
		The Nestable Tip Rack (NTR) is designed to stack disposable tip racks which increase the amount of disposable tips by factor 4 per SBS position compared to one layer tip locations. NTRs come with 5 stacks of 4 layers each and have to be placed onto NTR Carriers of the ML STAR instrument.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (780\).jpg" alt\="ntr2" data\-size\="original" width\="240" height\="210"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (781\).jpg" alt\="ntr1" data\-size\="original" width\="229" height\="223">
		
		  
		
		
		Tip pick up directly from loaded NTR Carriers is basically possible. This eliminates the need for intermediate tip pickup positions since pipetting tools such as single 1000ul pipetting channels as well as MultiProbeHeads (MPH 96 and MPH 384\) can pick up tips from the NTR stack in most cases.
		
		A transport system (e.g. iSwap, CO\-RE Gripper) is required to remove and dispose empty NTR frames away from NTR Stacks to allow access with the Pipetting Tools to the next lower layer with filled NTRs.
		
		Forcing Pipetting Tools to go down to lower or to the lowest layer of the NTR stack may have limitations due to the required space between the Pipetting Tool and the neighbouring Carriers as well as its corresponding labware (also to other stacks, neighbour NTR’s, etc.). In these cases, an intermediate Tip pick up position becomes necessary. This intermediate tip pickup position is designed and available as an NTR MFX Module (MultiFlexModule, MULTIFLEX NTR 96 MODULE, and MULTIFLEX NTR 384 MODULE).
		
		The transport system as mentioned above must then be used to move NTRs to these intermediate Tip Pickup positions which enable constant tip pickup conditions in terms of the same X, Y and Z coordinates of a single NTR. Once the Tips out of the NTR frame of the intermediate tip pickup position are used up, the frame needs to be replaced by a new filled NTR.
		
		When single\-, row\- or column wise Tip pickup is required with MultiProbeHeads, an additional tip pickup position equipped with a Tip adapter becomes necessary. The tip adapter may be positioned onto a Tip Rack Carrier as well as on a MFX Tip Module (MULTIFLEX TIP MODULE).
		
		  
		
		
		The recommended workflow would be:
		
		
			1. Transportation of one NTR from a loaded NTR Carrier to the intermediate Tip pickup position
			2. Tip pickup with MPH out of the intermediate Tip pickup position
			3. Tip eject into the Tip adapter
			4. As desired; single\-, row\- or column wise (shifted) Tip pickup out of the Tip adapter
			5. Ready for pipetting<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (782\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		An empty NTR can be transported to the waste either by the iSWAP or the CO\- RE gripper. Note that the use of the CO\-RE gripper for transports to the waste needs a special library to grip the rack shifted. Otherwise it is not possible to move the rack to the default waste position on a ML STAR and ML STARlet.
		
		  
		
		
		[Working with the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head and Nestable Tip Racks will need some precautions (see also](#bookmark295) Section 11\.6\.3 Tip Pick\-up with CO\-RE 96 Probe Head).
		
		There is danger of collision when the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head is picking up tips from lower positions if the neighboring positions are completely filled:

	7. ‌Random Access with 16 1000µl\-Pipetting Channels‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	A 4\-Channel or 8\-Channel instrument has random access to all positions of the deck. This means that pipetting channel No. 1 (rear most) is able to aspirate from e.g. well H1 on a plate placed on the front most plate carrier position. Having more pipetting channels result to a smaller random access area. This is because of the number of pipetting channels that must be moved over. Random access means that (e.g. due to a hit picking) the order of pipetting channels to proceed a sequence may be random.
	
	Deck Areas for Random Access of Different Numbers of Pipetting Channels
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (792\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="566" height\="246">
	
	  
	
	
	The 16\-Channel Instrument is intended to be used as a batch\-like processor. This means that all 16 pipetting channels should aspirate and dispense simultaneously in order to allow maximum parallel organization and highest pipetting speed. In this case, the reduced random access space of a 16\-Channel Instrument does not cause any problems.
	
	To achieve a batch\-like process, all sequences involved must consist of blocks of at least 8, or better 16 positions. Sequence positions within a block must have:
	
	
		* The same x\-positions
		* Decreasing y\-positions from pipetting channel 1 (rear\-most) to 16 (front\-most) To program a method using single steps:
		* Select the option “**keep pattern**” within the “**Channel Settings**” Dialog in all single steps (tip pick\-up, tip eject, aspirate, dispense). Do not use the option “**All sequence positions**”.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (793\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The limitation of the random access area on an instrument deck is also valid for instruments equipped with 5ml\-pipetting channels and any combination of 1000µl\-pipetting channels and 5ml\-pipetting channels. Other equipment such as the tube gripper or the camera channel will also reduce the area for random channel access.
		
		Even if an error occurs and “**Exclude Channel**” is selected as an error recovery, the pattern will be kept.
		
		To program a method using Smart Steps perform the following:
		* Select “**Copy Pattern**”
		* Do not select “**Exclude Erroneous Positions**”
		* If sequences can be reloaded (in run time during the pipette command), deselect the option “**reducible by user**” to maintain the original block\-wise structure of the sequences
	8. ‌Dual Arm Programming‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	The VENUS Software is designed to handle tools (e.g. a pipetting tool and a plate handling tool) on different arms. The software monitors each movement of the individual arms of the ML STAR dual arm instruments. If one arm needs priority to pass, the second arm is moved to a safe position first. In this manner, the two arms and the tools on the arms will not crash into each other. The programmer has not to care about sudden collisions in the system.
	
	VENUS Dynamic Scheduler
	
	[For the programming of a dual arm instrument, Hamilton recommends to use the VENUS Dynamic Scheduler software package. This package is not part of the basic VENUS Software described in this manual. Ask a local Hamilton Representative for more information or visit our Home page:](http://www.hamiltonrobotics.com/) [www.hamiltonrobotics.com](http://www.hamiltonrobotics.com/)[.](http://www.hamiltonrobotics.com/)
	
	The dynamic scheduler has several advantages and is specially designed for handling complex parallels in an assay. The administration of other devices, such as plate handler, plate washer, reader, etc., is just as easy as the programming of the dual arm configuration.
	
	Compared to the basic VENUS Software, there are advantages of the additional software package (VENUS Dynamic Scheduler), especially the programming of the parallel task. Each arm is defined as a so\-called “**Resource**”. The dynamic scheduler allows defining one resource (arm) as the major and the other as the minor device. The major arm always has the right of way. The dynamic scheduler automatically organizes the optimal use of the resources.
	
	Dual arms also can be programmed by the basic VENUS Software of the ML STAR. Carriers used by both arms should be placed in the middle of the pathway reachable by both arms. If one arm is moving to the common carrier(s), the other arm should not be obstructed in its tasks. Also, the programmer must decide whether the tasks of the two arms work in parallel or not (e.g. one arm must wait until the other has finished its task).
	9. ‌Sample Tracker‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	The sample tracker is a system to record all actions related to labware and liquids (such as pipetting, moving plates). It can generate a file for each piece of labware on the ML STAR, recording information about its history (pipetting patterns, barcodes, pipetting errors, etc.) during one method.
	
	With this information from the sample tracker, the user can:
	
	
		* Know what happened on the ML STAR during the runs
		* Know, whether the ML STAR did its work correctly or not
		* Use the output to link it to a LIMS
		* Use the output file for documentation (GLP)  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (794\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	To configure, collect and visualize tracker data, use the Generate Mapping File step from the Data handling step collection.
	
	  
	
	
	Enabling the sample tracker through the System Configuration Editor creates a database where all relevant information will be stored.
	
	To change the settings, click from the “Tools  System Configuration Editor” Menu.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (795\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="471" height\="276">
	
	  
	
	
	Mark the “**Data Handling Steps**[” Checkbox when linking the instrument or layout, to be able to use the functions accessing the sample tracker information (see](#bookmark180) [Section 7\.2 Linking a Deck to](#bookmark180) aMethod).
	
	Once the access functions are activated for a method, the group “**Data Handling Steps**” in the toolbox window of the Method Editor will contain the sample tracker steps.

		2. ### ‌Generating a Mapping File‌
		
		  
		
		
		To use this step, select the following:
		
		
			* instrument
			* Sequence over which the data should be generatedThe step is able to filter (expand) the stored information by selecting additional sequences in such a way that the additional information is stored which are affected by the sequences.
		
		Define the path and filename where the collected information will be stored. If there is no path specified, it will automatically be stored in the **HAMILTON\\Logfiles** directory by default.
		
		Make sure that the labware is loaded before calling this command.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (802\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="518" height\="296">
		
		  
		
		
		The “**Generate Mapping File**” Step collects data regarding the TARGET sequence and “**looks**” backwards as to what was pipetted into this sequence. Specify “**Sequences of interest**” to filter the information.
		
		Example: Pipette from a tube carrier into the target plate (red to green). Afterwards, cover the samples in the plate with the reagent (blue to green).
		
		To track both pipetting, both of the source sequences have to be added as “**Sequences of interest**”.
		
		To link only the barcode of the sample tube to the well ID of the target plate, only add the sample tube sequence to the “**Sequences of interest**”.
		3. ### ‌Customizing the Mapping File‌
		
		  
		
		
		The **\[Customize]** Button offers multiple options to customize the output mapping file. It is possible to:
		
		
			* Filter the data by using the status of the sample.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (803\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="476" height\="139">
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (804\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			When the aspirate step is mixing the liquid, it will create an entry in the database. To suppress this liquid transfer, check the checkbox “**Exclude multiple entries if source is mixed**”. Otherwise, at least two lines per sample will be found.
			* Sort the data in line wise (A1 – A12\) or column wise (A1 – H1\).
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (805\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="458" height\="64">
			
			  
			
			
			It is possible to link the default column name of the mapping files column to a user defined column name (see lines 2, 4, 8 in the image below). Simply change the name in the right column. Make sure that the quotes are present. Alternatively, variables can be used in the column name fields.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (806\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="431" height\="149">
			* To hide columns in the output file, deactivate the checkbox (see lines 3, 5 and 6 in the image above).
			* Activating the “**Create one file for full sequence of interest**” will create one single output file even if the sequence of interest covers more than one labware. Unchecking this box will create a single output file for every labware of the sequence of interest.
			* The “**Open file to append**” will not overwrite an existing file with new data but add the new data to the end of the file.
			* Per default, the output excel file is created in the LogFiles folder (under C:\\Program Files\\HAMILTON\\..  depending on the language of the operating system). To change this path and the default name of the output file, use the field: “**String used to generate the mapping file name(s)**”.  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (807\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="586" height\="47">
		4. ### ‌Set Labware Barcode‌
		
		  
		
		
		The step “**Set Labware Barcode**“ is used for labware that has been positioned on the deck but cannot be identified by the built\-in barcode reader.
		
		The labware which the barcode has to be set must be identified either by the LabwareID (created in the Deck Layout Editor) or by the sequence which was defined by the Sequence Editor.
		
		The barcode to be set must either be a constant string or a variable. At run time, an error will be generated if the barcode passed is empty.
		5. ### ‌Remove Labware‌
		
		  
		
		
		The command “**Remove Labware**“ removes labware from the access of sample tracking. It is used for the labware which are removed from the deck. After this command has been executed, no more tracking data for the removed labware is accessible.
		6. ### ‌Import Worklist‌
		
		  
		
		
		The import worklist step is used to import an external database. The file format can be in Access, Excel or a structured text. The data in the external worklist can be assigned to the columns of the internal Hamilton database. This allows the use of the imported data within the VENUS Software environment and e.g. use the “**Load and Match**[” Step to connect the loaded barcodes to a previously imported worklist. Refer to](#bookmark312) Section 11\.11\.3 Importing a Worklist for more information.
		7. ### ‌Update Job Status‌
		
		  
		
		
		This command allows changing the status of a sequence position from 'Assigned' or 'Unprocessed' to ‘Processed’. The update is done on the current position of the given sequence.
	10. ‌Speed Up cLLD Detection‌
	------
	
	  
	
	
	Using the cLLD (capacitive Liquid Level Detection) can cause extended pipetting time when used on labware with high walls. The reason is that, the cLLD search starts at the LLD Search height which is defined in the labware, normally very close to the upper border.
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (808\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="315" height\="150">
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Having only small amounts of liquid in such labware, the pipetting channel starts almost at the upper border and travels a long way down to find liquid (see picture below with the “**first pipette**” label).
	
	  
	
	
	 quick z\-move
	
	 slow liquid search

 

first pipette following pipettes

  


Using the “**Speed up cLLD detection**” Function, the following aspirate / dispense steps will use a calculated height from the previously detected level. This reduces the total time for pipetting due to the decreased search time.

To enable Speed up cLLD detection apply the following settings.

Set the Sample Tracking in the System Configuration Editor (system settings) to **ON.**

Set the Speed up cLLD Detection in the System Configuration Editor (instrument) to **ON**.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (809\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="542" height\="125">

  


Make sure that the labware is higher than 40mm. The smaller labware will not benefit from this feature.

Make sure to use the cLLD in the desired steps (aspiration and/or dispense).

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (810\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

The system will calculate the amount of liquid in the tube when using the instrument. That means, when pipetting into a tube with pipetting channels, CO\- RE 96 Probe Head or other pipetting devices, the level will be adapted to the new height.

If the tube is filled up manually, the level is NOT adapted. The cLLD search in the liquid may start already and prompt an “**Unexpected liquid found**” error message.

1. ‌Working with Worklists‌
-----

  



	1. ### ‌File Formats‌
	
	  
	
	
	Frequently, there will be a need to import and export worklists. The “**Open file**” Command of the method editor is designed to enable such file handling. The data source type (format) is identified by the extension of the worklist file name. The editor supports formats listed in the table presented below. No other extensions are supported.
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| Microsoft Excel | .xls |
	| --- | --- |
	| Microsoft Access Database | .mdb |
	| Structured Text Files | .txt, .csv, .tab, .asc. |

	The FileRead / WriteSteps will read or write only ONE LINE of the file. To read through a complete file, use a loop.
	
	The example below shows how to use the file commands. First, the file is opened by using the File: Open step. The path (C:\\\\Temp\\\\Worklist.xls) and sheet name (Absorbance$) are specified. Columns (LabID / PosID / OD) are linked to variables (xls\_LabID / xls\_PosID / xls\_OD) respectively.
	
	A loop is inserted to make sure that the file is read from the beginning to end. Inside the loop, the File: Read step reads line per line and assigns the values from the file into the variables.
	
	In this case, the LabID and PosID are read out and are used to create sequence positions through the SeqAdd step.
	
	To end, the file is closed (otherwise, it remains open and exclusively locked by the method).

	4. ### ‌Worklist Handling with Microsoft Excel‌
	
	  
	
	
	Specifying a subset of the available data can be done when a Microsoft Excel workbook file is open. It is possible to open either of the following:
	
	
		* A single worksheet
		* A named range anywhere in the workbook
		* An unnamed range in a single worksheetThe following table lists the conventions for these settings.
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| To open this object to read... | ...use this syntax |
	| --- | --- |
	| Entire worksheet in a workbook file | Specify the sheet as sheetname$, where sheetname is the name of the worksheet.Important: A worksheet name must end with a dollar sign ($). |
	| Named range of cells in a worksheet or workbook file | Specify the named range as NamedRange, where NamedRange is the name assigned to the range in Microsoft Excel.Important: The range in Microsoft Excel must be named before attempting to open it. |
	| Unnamed range of cells in a single worksheet in a workbook file | Specify the sheet to be opened as sheetname$ and the range as FirstCellInRange:LastCellInRange. For example, to access cells A1 through Z256 in a worksheet called Sales, Sales$A1:Z256 is specified. |
	| To open this object to write... | ...use this syntax |
	| Entire worksheet in a workbook file | Specify the sheet as sheetname, where sheetname is the name of the worksheet.Important: Do not end the worksheet name with a dollar sign ($). |
	| To append to an object | ...use this syntax |
	| Append to an existing worksheet in a workbook file | Specify the sheet as sheetname$, where sheetname is the name of the worksheet.Important: A worksheet name must end with a dollar sign ($). |
	| Append to a not yet existing worksheet in a workbook file | Specify the sheet as sheetname, where sheetname is the name of the worksheet.Important: Do not end the worksheet name with a dollar sign ($). |
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (832\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	A value in a range that exceeds the maximum number of rows, columns, or sheets for the worksheet or workbook cannot be specified. For more information on these values, refer to the Microsoft Excel documentation.
	
	The format of all entries within a column in the Excel file must be identical: text, number, etc.
	
	The handling (open/read/write/… file) of Excel files using the VENUS Software files do not require the installation of Microsoft Excel.
2. ‌Using Libraries‌
--------

  


A library is a collection of standard functions which the programmer can choose from when writing methods in addition to the toolbox elements. The best\-known functions are the mathematical functions. For these, VENUS Software provides a mathematical function library. There are several other libraries that can be found to be useful. If the library required hasn’t been installed yet, install it through "Tools  Hamilton Support Software...".

To use library functions in a method, include the appropriate library. Follow these steps:


	1. Select "Method  Libraries..." in the Labware Editor to open the dialog seen below.
	2. To add a library, click the Browse Button **\[...]** at the center of the table highlighted below or click the **\[Add Library...]** Button.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (833\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="433" height\="207">
	3. In the file selection box, select the required library to be imported. Click **\[OK].**
	4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to import all the libraries needed.
	5. Click **\[OK]** to close the dialog. The selected library functions are available under their own group tab in the toolbox and can be used like standard commands.
	6. To remove libraries, select the libraries to be removed and click the **\[Remove Library]** Button.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (834\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	If a method uses at least on function of a library, the library cannot be removed.
	
	  
	
	
	VENUS Software supports two kinds of libraries: HSL Libraries (\*.hsl) and Sub\-method Libraries (\*.smt).
	
	A library function can also be self\-written and can be used like any standard library through the following:
	
	
		* Graphical Method Editor (to create a Sub\-method library)
		* HSL Method Editor (to create an HSL library)
	1. ### ‌Array Library‌

	2. ### ‌Barcode Library‌
	
	Array Library is an old library. Its functions should not be used anymore. All array\-related steps can be found in the General Steps. Arrays can be used directly in most steps.
	
	  
	
	
	The HSLBarcodeReader library supports the Metrologic barcode scanner Orbit/MS7120 for read operations over the serial interface RS232\.

	15. ### ‌Report Library‌
	
	  
	
	
	The HSL report library provides functions to create report files for labware out of the sample tracking database within a method run (e.g.: a comma separated value result file (.csv) or an AT barcode file).
	
	The “**HSLReport**” Prefix has been removed for a better overview.
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| Command | Icon | Action Performed |
	| --- | --- | --- |

	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1067\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	In creating an AT\-Barcode file for vials containing more than one barcode (for example sample \+ reagent were dispensed into this well, both came from containers with a barcode), the last barcode in the pipetting order will be written into the AT\-Barcode file.
	
	To prevent overwriting, a sample barcode of a reagent barcode (reagent dispensed after the sample) has to be deleted. To do this, set an empty string as a barcode for the container using the SetLabwareBarcode command from the HSLLabwareState library between loading and pipetting.
	16. ### ‌Sequence Library‌
	
	  
	
	
	The sequence library is very helpful for advanced sequence creation and handling.

	25. ### ‌HSL VacuumBrandPump / ML STAR BVS Library‌
	
	  
	
	
	The ML STAR BVS Library allows controlling up to four BVS / CVS units simultaneously. There are two categories of functions provided:
	
	High Level Functions
	
	The high level functions control the whole vacuum process including tracking of the vacuum action to the Hamilton Database.
	
	The use of HighLevelFunctions is recommended. High level functions have the prefix **HSLStarBVSLib.**
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1253\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	The BVS Library can also be used for CVS.
	26. ### ‌Low Level Functions‌
	
	  
	
	
	These functions reflect the command set of the “**BVS pump controller**” directly. These commands are old and are not recommended to be used anymore.
	
	Low level functions have the prefix **HSLVacuuBrandPump**.

3. ‌Customized Error Handling‌
--------

  


For various error situations, a defined walk\-away error handling which uses predefined default settings can be set. Smart Steps, Easy Steps and Single Steps offer this possibility.

Three different levels of error handling are determined:

Fully manual:

This behavior is the standard error handling.


	1. An error dialog will be prompted.
	2. The user has to select or indicate a recovery action that will be executed.
	3. After doing so, the recovery action dialog has to be closed by the user.Semi\-automated:


	1. An error dialog will be prompted.
	2. The user has to select or indicate a recovery action that will be executed.
	3. The recovery action dialog will appear in a limited time. If the user does not specify an error recovery during the given timeframe, the dialog box closes automatically and will execute the default error handling.Fully automated (walk away):


	1. No error dialog opens on the screen.
	2. The first defined recovery action will be executed immediately after an occurrence of an error.
	3. If the first recovery action is unsuccessful, the second defined recovery action will be executed.
	
	For every instrument\-specific easy/single step of the method, an individual error recovery can be defined. The following configurations are possible:
	
	
		* Appearance of the error recovery dialogs (which buttons are available)
		* Default procedure
		* Which error is flagged in the trace file
		* A timeout (the timeframe of the dialog when it will automatically close down) after which the default recovery action will be executed
		
		To Customize the Settings:
		
		Disable the “**Use Default**” and the “**Timeout: Infinite**” Checkboxes. Only then the other settings become editable. A brief error description is given, followed by the available recovery options. Only one default procedure can be selected.
		
		Among the choices are:
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		| Cancel | Quits the current step and starts the user defined error handling if specified. If no user defined error handling is present, the method aborts. |
		| --- | --- |
		| Abort | Aborts the method |
		| Bottom | Repeat the step at the bottom of the container |
		| Exclude | Exclude all pipetting channels with this error and continue |
		| Repeat | Repeat the command |
		| Air | Aspirate air and continue |
		* Use the “**Visible**” Flag to add the appropriate button to the error recovery dialog box.
		* The “**Set error flag**” will mark an erroneous container in the database.
		* It is also possible to enable walk\-away handling of errors (semi\- and fully\-automated mode):
		* Disable the “**Timeout: Infinite**” Checkbox. Enter a timeout into the input field. The run time error dialog then pops\-up, waits for the specified timeout and closes to continue with the default error recovery chosen for this error. If the timeout is set to 0, no dialog will open: the selected error recovery will be executed automatically.
		* If the user clicks on the error during the timeout, the walk\-away will be stopped, and the user has to select a recovery and continue manually.
		* For a list of all errors and their recovery options, refer to the online\-help and the error settings dialog.
		
		Because of this, every instrument\-specific Smart Step, Easy Step or Single Step has an **\[Error Settings…]** Button. Here is an example of the “**1000μl Channel Aspirate**” (Single Step):

	1. ### ‌Example 1: Error Settings with Easy/ Single Steps‌
	
	  
	
	
	This example shows how to configure an Easy Step Aspirate to repeat the aspiration in case of a clot error. If the second aspiration fails as well, the erroneous pipetting channel will be excluded.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1340\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="337" height\="126">
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1341\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="413" height\="329">
	
	As seen in the image above, the checkboxes “**Use Default**” and the “**Timeout: Infinite**” are not activated.
	
	Subsequently, the first recoveries are activated. In this case, a REPEAT error is selected as the first error handling. It first tries one time to aspirate the sample probe. In case of a clot, the aspirated liquid is dispensed with half speed. Afterwards a second attempt at aspiration occurs. After a failed repeat attempts, this pipetting channel is excluded (second recovery \= EXCLUDE).
	
	Based on this principle, the desired error handling can be set for every listed error.
	2. ### ‌Example 2: Error Handling by the User‌
	
	  
	
	
	If none of the pre\-defined possibilities in the error setting matches the user’s needs, an individual error handling can be programmed through the step “**Error Handling by the User**”.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1342\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="522" height\="341">
	
	  
	
	
	The steps to be observed are programmed in between “**Begin Error Handling by the User**” and “**End Error Handling by the User**”.
	
	If any error occurs in such a step, the method proceeds to the steps between “**Begin Error Handler**” and “**End Error Handler**”. This is the user defined error handling.
	
	As a result, every desired error handling can be programmed.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1343\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	The error settings of the specific error in the corresponding step have to be set to CANCEL to be able to use the “**Error Handling by the User**”.
	
	To make use of the “**Error Handling by the User**”, the settings listed below must be considered. The example on the previous page shows a “**1000μl Channel Aspirate**” Step where the clot handling is controlled through the “**Error Handling by the User**”:
	
	
		1. Unmark the “**Use default**” Checkbox
		2. Unmark the “**Infinite**” Checkbox
		3. Set the **\[Cancel]** Radio Button

2. ‌Demo Methods for the ML STAR‌
=========


	1. ‌Overview‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	Most of the instrument’s day\-to\-day operations will be driven by methods, so it is important that these are correctly defined and are at the same time easy to operate.
	
	Storage of Methods
	
	Programmed methods are stored in the methods sub\-directory on the hard disk. They can be opened, edited and saved either in the graphical Method Editor or in the text\-like HSL Method Editor.
	
	Purpose of this Section
	
	This section is a step\-by\-step approach on how to program a number of simple methods which are normally used in laboratories. Following these steps will help in becoming familiar with the layout and how the software works. Modifying the suggested methods to suit particular requirements or programming new methods based on what is suggested can then be done.

	NOTE
	
	[Due to the current installation, a reduced selection of commands might be available. To make all commands or the commands of interest available, enable them in the Configuration Editor. Refer to](#bookmark66) [Section 3\.4 Step](#bookmark66) Selection [and / or](#bookmark71) Section 3\.5 ML STAR Settings.

	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1346\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="58">
	
	ATTENTION
	
	Ensure that all methods are tested. It is recommended to run a simulation first, followed by a water run and (if successful), a run with real liquids.
	
	The programmer is responsible for the validation of the method.
	
	Note that the methods developed for one particular instrument and configuration do not automatically fit to another instrument or configuration. Differences in hardware and labware make revisions of programmed methods necessary.
	
	Make sure to validate the method to be used for the instrument and configuration, particularly when importing methods from one computer or instrument to another.
	
	The Demo Methods
	
	The examples in the next pages will describe how to create own layouts, methods and sequences.
	
	The demonstration examples can help in understanding the details which are not specifically described in the document.
	2. ‌Method for Sample Preparation using the Action Editor‌
	--------
	
	  
	
	
	The action editor is a helpful tool for graphical method creation. It should be activated if the scheduling software is NOT installed. If scheduling software is installed, the same icon will start the activity editor.
	
	This demo will:
	
	
		* Aspirate buffer from a reagent trough
		* Aliquot this over a Microplate, starting at A1
		* Aspirate samples from three tube racks
		* Dispense them into the same target plate and mixThe transferred volume will be 50μl of buffer and 100μl of the sample. The method is named “**MixSampleAndBuffer**”. The method uses new CO\-RE tips for every well. Start with an empty target plate.
	
	First, create a new method. This will also add a Deck Layout with the same name (“**MixSampleAndBuffer**”**.lay**). The Deck Layout for this method is shown in the picture below.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1347\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="598" height\="190">
	
	  
	
	
	Creating the Deck Layout:
	
	
		1. Start the Method Editor by clicking on the “**Hamilton Method Editor**” Shortcut on the desktop.
		2. Select “File  New  Method” to create a new method. A window will open to be able to save the new method.
		3. Enter the filename (MixSampleAndBuffer) and click **\[Save]**. A new method window and system deck window are opened in the Method Editor. To activate, click on the system deck window.
		4. Click the “**ML\_STAR**” Tab in the lower left corner.
		5. Make sure the “**1000μl Channels**” Stamp Tool is selected to define the sorting of the default sequences when adding labware.
		6. Click the on the “**Labware**” Tab.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1348\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="598" height\="121">
		7. In the tree list right above the tabs, expand “ML STAR Carriers  Plate Carriers” and select “PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00”. This is a carrier for microplates.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1349\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="492" height\="127">
		
		An image of the selected carrier is shown in the right\-hand box.
		8. “Drag and Drop” the carrier from the box onto the deck.
		9. Repeat the steps above to add a tip carrier with 300μl Tips (without filter). Click “ML STAR Carriers  Tip Carriers 96” and “Drag and Drop” the TIP\_CAR480\_BC\_ST\_A00 onto the deck.
		10. Following the previous steps, add three sample carriers to the deck. Click “**ML STAR Carriers**
		
		 Sample Carriers  32 positions  SMP\_CAR\_32\_12x95\_A00” and drag it onto the deck. Repeat this step until there are 3 sample carriers on the deck.
		11. Same as the steps above, add a reagent carrier preloaded with 3 reagent troughs to the deck. Click “ML STAR Carriers  Reagent Carriers  RGT\_CAR\_3R\_A01” and drag it onto the deck.
		12. Place the target plate on the plate carrier. Click “Plates  96 position plates 
		
		Nunc\_96\_Fl\_Lb (low border)” and drag the plate to the carrier position 5\.
		13. Right click on the plate and select “**Properties**” in the Context Menu.
		14. Change the LabwareID of the plate to “**TargetPlate**”.

	4. ‌Method to Copy from Plate to Plate using Single and Easy Steps‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	The method that will be discussed in this section does exactly the same as the method “**OnePlateToPlatePipette**[” described in](#bookmark363) [Section 12\.3 Method to Copy from Plate to Plate](#bookmark363) using[Smart](#bookmark363) Steps. The only difference is that the method is now written using Easy Steps instead of Smart Steps. Here, no sample reduction is possible.
	
	This method uses the same Deck Layout as the method used with the Smart Steps.
	
	
		1. Open this system Deck Layout and create the easy step version using the following guide:
		2. Create a new method called “**OnePlateToPlateEasySteps**”.
		3. The method can be written easily by “Dragging and Dropping” the icons from the toolbox into the method window. The resulting method looks like this:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1402\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="472" height\="376">
		4. The first step is an initialize step. In the “**ML\_STAR**” toolbar, drag “**Initialize**” to the main window. A window will be displayed.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1403\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="214" height\="111">
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1404\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		In using a single step in the beginning of a method, the initialize command has to be added prior to the single step.
		
		When using Smart Steps and Easy Steps, the initialization will be executed automatically.
		5. Drag “**Load Carrier**” into the next line of the method.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1405\).png" alt\="C:\\Temp\\SNAGHTML62c15d.PNG" data\-size\="original" width\="218" height\="197">
		6. This command loads the carriers automatically onto the instrument deck during run time.
		7. Specify the name of the carrier to be loaded.
		8. Click **\[Advanced…]** to display the path where the plate barcodes are stored, under the default file name “**barcode\_1\.txt**” (Note that the checkbox “**barcode trace**” within the configuration editor must be checked to generate the file). The positions on the deck are automatically retrieved from the Deck Layout during run time.

		9. Click **\[OK]** twice.
		10. Repeat the “**Load Carrier**” Command for the target plate carrier and the source carrier.
		11. To copy the whole source plate and not just the first 8 wells to the target plate, the steps “**Tip pick\-up**”, “**Aspiration**”, “**Dispense**” and “**Tip eject**” have to be performed 12 times (96 wells divided by 8 pipetting channels). This can be achieved using a loop command.
		12. The loop statement consists of two lines, a “**begin loop**” and an “**end loop**” statement. The codes is inserted between these two statements will be looped.
		13. Drag the “**Loop**” Command from the General Steps into the next line of the method window.
		14. The “**Loop**” Dialog window will appear as follows:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1407\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="393" height\="344">
		15. A loop can be performed looping:
		
		
			* Over a fixed number of iterations
			* An expression (repeat which the statement in the expression is true)
			* A sequence
			* A file (until end\-of\-file is reached)
		16. In this example, a looping over the “**SourcePlate**” Sequence is done. This means, that the loop will continue until all sequence positions (the 96 wells) of the “**SourcePlate**” have been used. Only then the loop will stop.
		17. Choose the default “**after loop**” for the “**Reset Sequence**” Option, to reset the sequence “**SourcePlate**” to the initial position (1\) after the loop is done. If a pipette with the same sequence “**SourcePlate**” will be performed once more at a later time, the sequence will then start at the first well again.

	6. ‌Method for Hit Picking using Smart Steps‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	Assume that there is a source plate and a photometer reads the optical absorbance of the wells of the plate. Create a target plate with all the compounds in the source plate having an absorbance of A\>1\.0E.
	
	The ‘hit picking’ method exactly does this. The photometric results are retrieved from a file, and a sequence of hits (A\>1\.0E) is created ‘on the fly’ according to the absorbencies that have been read. Pipetting then occurs according to the sequence.
	
	For this method, a source containing the absorbencies of the 96 wells of the source microplate is needed. The database can be either of the following:
	
	
		* ASCII text file
		* Microsoft Excel file
		* Microsoft Access database
		* Vector database
		
		In this example, the database used is a Microsoft Excel file. The name of the Excel sheet being used is “**Absorbance**”. The sheet contains three columns, as follows:
		* “**LabID**” defining the plate name of the source plate (“**Source\_1**” for the first plate and “**Source\_2**” for the second plate)
		* “**PosID**” defining the position in the microplate alphanumerically (A1, A2, …, H12\)
		* absorbance or optical density “**OD**” in mE
		
		The worklist then has 193 lines, 1 header line and the entries from 2 plates with 96 wells each.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1426\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="219" height\="206">
		
		  
		
		
		The Deck Layout contains (see picture below):
		* One tip carrier “**TIP\_CAR\_480\_ST\_A00\.tml**” preloaded with five standard volume tip racks
		* One plate carrier “**PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00\.tml**” with two Nunc plates “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_L.rck**”, which are the source plates (change the properties such that one plate is called “**Source\_1**” and the other “**Source\_2**”)
		* One plate carrier “**PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00\.tml**” with two Nunc plates “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_L.rck**”, which are the target plates<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1427\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="633" height\="202">
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. Create the “**Target**” Sequence by activating the “**Sequences**” Tab in the Deck Layout Editor.
		2. Click on **\[Clear selected]**.
		3. Activate the “**Channels**” Stamp Tool and create a sequence spanning the two target plates and name it as “**Target**”.
		4. Switch to the Method Editor window.
		5. Include the two libraries “**HSLTrcLib.hsl**” and “**HSLSeqLib.hsl**” in the method.  
	
	
	Creating the Method
	
	
		1. “Drag and Drop” the steps from the toolbox into the method, as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1428\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="401" height\="361">
		2. The first step is to request the user to input a threshold value for the absorption. This is saved as a variable called “**Threshold**”.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1429\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="346" height\="331">
		3. In the “**Prompt**” Field, type in the question to be asked to the user (do not forget to put the string in quotation marks for this is a text).
		4. Specify the “**Type**” (integer, float, string) of the input required. In this case, use a float type because this value will be used in an SQL statement.
		5. In the next fields, a default value that is already displayed when the dialog opens can be specified. Having an integer or float value, also minimum and maximum values can be defined.
		6. Click **\[OK]** to finish the user input.
		7. In the next step, create an SQL statement to get only the values with the specified OD or greater. The complete expression in the left field is:
		
		“**SELECT \* FROM \[Absorbance$] WHERE OD \>**”
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1430\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="549" height\="114">
		8. This will create a variable SQL\_Statement which depends on the user input, e.g. if the user types in 500 as threshold, the statement to open the excel file will be “**SELECT \* FROM \[Absorbance$] WHERE OD \> 500**”
		9. Here, “**Absorbance$**” refers to the name of the Excel sheet which is going to be opened during the next steps.
		10. Drag the “**Open File**” Icon into the method to open the file holding the absorbance information. The file format is also defined within this step as follows:
		11. Select the tab for opening “**Microsoft Excel**” Files.
		12. Under “**File name (\*.xls)**”, enter the file name. When browsing for the file, the full absolute path is required with the filename. Note that the backslash must be written twice. To use a relative path, delete it or simply enter the path enclosed in quotation marks.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1431\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML69ba7a" data\-size\="original" width\="318" height\="363">
		13. The file type is an Excel file (.xls) where the sheet name (sheet1 if not defined otherwise, language dependent) and the $ sign must be added within the quotation marks.
		14. Define a file handle (here the default: “**file1**”) which is a name for the file used within the method. Later, data will be read from this file by referring to this file handle.
		15. Select “**Open File to Read**” as the mode to read data from this file.
		16. Now, define the file format. Here, a variable is assigned to each column of the file. Later, for each reading step, one record (one line) is read from the file, and the contents read are assigned to their corresponding variables automatically.
		17. Now define the file structure. One line in the “**Column specification**” of the file opening dialog represents one column in the file. Click on the **\[Add]** Button to add the next line to the dialog.
		18. Enter the data as given in the screenshot above. Assign a header, a variable and a variable type to each column.
		19. Select the variable “**sql\_statement**” from the dropdown list as a command string.
		20. Click **\[OK]** to finish the definition.
		21. Create a loop after opening but before closing the input file. This will loop over the file until the file has been read completely.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1432\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="356" height\="307">
		22. Within the loop, the first record of the file is read.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1433\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="231" height\="107">
		23. As the file is being read, the variables defined in “**Open File**” will be filled with the information found.
		24. Use the “**SeqAdd**” Library Function. This command will add positions to a sequence when giving the LabID/PosID information (see image below).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1434\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="498" height\="310">
		25. In the sequence “**Name**” Field, insert a sequence name. Since in this example, a completely new sequence is being created for all the hits “**AllHits**”, a name can directly be typed in. The system will then create a new sequence with the specified name.
		26. Because the SQL selection string automatically skips all records with absorption values less than or equal to the value of the “**Threshold**” Variable, no other selection statements such as IF/ELSE are required.
		27. In the “**LabwareId** “/ “**PositionId**” fill the two variables from the file open.
		28. After the loop, use the “**TrcTraceSequence**” Command to see which positions have been added to the “**AllHits**” Sequence. This command will list all sequence positions in the trace window.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1435\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="421" height\="262">
		29. Add a “**Load**” Smart Step. After the file has been analyzed and the hit sequence has been generated, the loading of the sequences (carriers) onto the deck may start.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1436\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="351" height\="268">

		NOTE
		
		The “**AllHits**” Sequence was created in the previous step and the current position of the sequence is undefined.
		
		To set, use the SetCurrentPosition command from the General Steps or in the load step, set the start Position to 1\.
		30. Add the “**1000μl Channel Pipette \- Simple**” Smart Step into the method to start pipetting.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1438\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="347" height\="377">
		31. In this step of the wizard, make sure that the control sequence is properly defined (see image below). The “**AllHits**” Aspiration Sequence is the controlling sequence and therefore is not reloadable. The target sequence is not reloadable either.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1439\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="391" height\="186">
		32. The rest of the settings made are very similar to the previous example “**OnePlateToPipette**”.
		33. To end with, add a step for unloading.

		2. ### ‌Programming a Column Serial Dilution with CO\-RE 384 STP Probe Head‌
		
		  
		
		
		This section describes how to program a column wise serial dilution using the CO\-RE 384 STP. The samples are in column 1 of the plate. The 384 Head pipettes diluent from the diluent container and transfers the mix to column 2\. This is repeated until column 24, so there is a decreasing concentration of sample in every column.
		
		Close all open windows and create a method called “**Demo384SerialDilution.med**”.
		
		  
		
		
		Creating the Deck Layout
		
		
			1. From the “**Sequence**” Tab, select the “**Head 384 Column**” Stamp Tool.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1460\).gif" alt\="384stamptool" data\-size\="original" width\="319" height\="217">
			2. Activate the “**Labware**” Tab and add the “**Core384SlideWaste**” onto the deck.
			3. Add a “**TIP384\_CAR\_1920\_50ul**” Carrier to the deck.
			4. Add a “**TIP\_CAR\_480\_A00**” to the deck.
			5. On the empty tip carrier, place a “**TipSupport\_50ul\_384\_STP\_Head**” in position 2\.
			6. Add a “**PLT\_CAR\_L5AC\_A00**” Carrier to the deck.
			7. On the plate carrier, add a “**Nun\_300ml\_384C\_Rgt\_L.rck**” in position 3\. With a right mouse click, enter the “**Properties…**” and change the “**LabwareID**” to “**Diluent**”.
			8. On the plate carrier, add a “**Nun\_384\_Sq.rck**” in position 2\. Change the “**LabwareID**” to “**Target**”.
			9. The Deck Layout should look as shown below.
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1461\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="433" height\="211">
			10. The final method should look like this:  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1462\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="607" height\="435">
		
		  
		
		
		Step 1 is the initialization of the instrument.
		
		Steps 2 and 3: bring the tips from the tip rack to the tip support for column wise tip pick up. Steps 4 to 7: pipette the diluent over the full plate except column 1 (where the sample is). Steps 8 to 11: Aspirate from the previous column and mix with the following column.
		
		Creating the Sequences
		
		Only one additional sequence is used in this method. Make sure the stamp tool is still set to “**Head 384 Column**”. Create a sequence over the target plate WITHOUT selecting column one. Name it “**TargetPlate\_Diluent**”.

		Creating the Method
		
		
			1. First, insert an “**Initialize**” Step, then use the “**CO\-RE 384 Head Tip Pick Up (Single Step)**” to pick up the tips from the tip rack.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1464\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="296" height\="186">
			2. Move the tips to the TipSupport using the “**CO\-RE 384 Head Tip Pick Eject (Single Step)**”. Set the input field to “**(0\) OFF**” because the tips do not go to the default waste. For “**Destination**”, select the tip support sequence.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1465\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="290" height\="219">
			3. The next step is a “**Loop**” Step to make sure the distribution of diluent continues over the full “**TargetPlate\_Diluent**” Sequence (all columns except column 1\). Use the option “**Iterate over sequence and adjust sequence**” and select “**ML\_STAR.TargetPlate\_Diluent**”.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1466\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="289" height\="251">
			4. The loop is followed by the aspiration of diluent (with only one column of tips). Use the “**CO\-RE 384 Head Aspirate**” Step and use the following settings:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1467\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML73f69f" data\-size\="original" width\="220" height\="346">
			
			  
			
			
			Tip Mode: (0\) All the column wise setting is made in the “Customize” later
			
			Aspiration sequence: ML\_STAR.Diluent
			
			Auto increment: Not ticked
			
			Volume: 40ul
			
			TipType: 50µl tip for 384
			5. The liquid class is selected automatically after specifying the liquid “**Water**”.
			6. The tip pickup sequence should be “**ML\_STAR.CORE384\_TipSupport\_50ul\_L\_0001**”.
			7. Now, the column wise tip pickup must be specified in the “**Customize**” Tab, found in the “**Channel Settings**” Section.
			8. Make sure the “**Reduced pattern mode**” is set to “**(4\) Column(s)**”. The column 24 is then automatically activated to be used for the tip pick up.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1468\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="410" height\="420">
			9. Other possible selections for “**Reduced pattern mode**” are: “**(0\) All**” to pick up all tips
			
			“**(1\) One Channel**” to pick up one tip in the corner of the head
			
			“**(2\) Quarter**” to have ¼ of the tips picked up. Quarter selection has different rears as shown below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1469\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="224" height\="53">
			
			  
			
			
			“**(3\) Row(s)**” for row\-wise tip pickup and pipetting
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1470\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="58">
			
			ATTENTION
			
			This is the pattern of the CO\-RE 384 Probe Head and NOT the pipetting pattern on the plate.
			10. To pick up two columns of tips, activate column 23 by clicking on the column number 23 as well. Through this, several columns can be activated and will be picked up.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1471\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			It is not possible to have gaps (empty lines) in the pattern. To create such a pattern, use a second tip support and move the tips to the according columns, rows, quarters or single positions.
			11. If a reduced pattern mode other than “**(0\) All**” is used, please read about the risks and limitations in the Help of the step  CO\-RE 384 Head Pattern Mode Limitations.
			12. It is also possible to use a variable for the columns or rows to be used. Example for column variable: “**000000000000000000000011**”, where every character represents a column.
			13. “**0**” (zero) stands for not used column, “**1**” (one) for used column. In the example, the columns 23 and 24 will be used for tip pick up. For rows, only 16 values must be passed.
			14. After the aspiration, insert a “**CO\-RE 384 Head Dispense**” Step and fill the input fields as follows:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1472\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="430" height\="299">
			15. Make sure that the “**Auto increment**” Box is ticked.
			16. The volume should be as big as the aspiration volume, or simply activate the “**Dispense remaining volume**” Checkbox.
			
			The tip pattern is taken from the aspiration step, so no changes are necessary here.
			17. With this step, the distribution of the diluent over the plate is finished. There is a choice whether to throw away the tips or to keep them. Use the ‘Tip handling after dispense’ to apply the settings.
			18. Now, a second loop is needed to perform the transfer from column to column. With 24 columns, 23 transfers are needed. Therefore, the second loop can iterate over the fixed number of times.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1473\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="238" height\="65">
			19. Inside the second loop, the aspirate of the sample is executed. To do so, use a “**CO\-RE 384 Head Aspirate**” Step with the settings shown below. If the step from line 5 of the method is copied, there is no need to repeat the tip pattern settings in the “**Customize**” Tab (to use only one column).
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1474\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="336" height\="288">
			20. It is important that the “**Auto increment**” Box is ticked. This will ensure that the aspirated liquid is transported to the next column for dispensing.
			21. In the lower section, use a fixed pipetting height of 3mm. Keep in mind that this height may differ if other plates are used.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1475\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="381" height\="159">
			22. The dispense step may now be programmed. Add (or copy from above) the “**CO\-RE 384 Head Dispense**” using the settings below:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1476\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="364" height\="253">
			23. The target plate is used both as aspirate and dispense location to get the serial dilution. Since the “**Auto increment**” on the Aspirate step was checked, the dispense step always uses the next column and because the next aspiration should happen in the same column, the “**Auto increment**” Checkbox must be unchecked on the dispense step.
			24. Again, set a fixed height for dispensing then switch to the “**Customize**” Section. The “**Minimize z\-move after step**” can be activated since dispensing is performed on one plate only. This will prevent the head from moving up to traverse height, which is time saving.
			25. Activate the mixing function when dispensing the diluent into the sample. Use the “**Customize**” Tab to enter the “**Advanced Dispense**” Section.
			26. Enter the values for the mixing as follows:
			
			
				* Cycles \= 4
				* Mix position \= 2
				* Volume \= 20
			27. Close the step by clicking **\[OK]** twice.
	9. ‌Create a Sub\-Method‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	The following example demonstrates how to:
	
	
		* Build sub\-methods into the method.
		* Activate a sub\-method library for a particular functionThis example sub\-method will be performing the pipetting from a source to a target plate.
	
	Since sub\-methods are created in the ‘main’ – method, it is not necessary to define a Deck Layout for the sub\-method(s).
	
	
		1. To create a local sub\-method, right\-click on the “**Method**” in the method window and select “**Local Sub\-methods**”. Name the sub\-method “**CheckLoadedTubeCarrier**”.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1477\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="358" height\="123">
		2. The parameter window shown below appears. Supply the following parameters with the following values:
		
		
			* Sub method name: “**CheckLoadedTubeCarrier**”
			* Description: optional
			* Parameters: “**CarrierToLoad” of type** “ Sequence”
			* Sub\-method name: “**Pipetting**”
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1478\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="489" height\="231">
		3. The empty sub\-method will then appear.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1479\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="252" height\="43">
		4. Create the sub\-method by “Dragging and Dropping” Steps from the toolbox to the step editor.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1480\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="489" height\="310">
		5. The pathname settings for the unformatted text file (step 7 of the image above), the formatted Excel file (Step 8 of the image above) and the sheet name of the Excel file (Step 9 of the image above) are all set using the “**Assignment**” Command from the General Steps.
		6. Then the new carrier is then loaded.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1481\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="364" height\="276">
		7. Use the “**CarrierToLoad**“ Variable from the parameter window as the carrier name.
		8. In the “**Advanced settings**”, set the barcode file name to the variable “**BarcodeFileText**” that has been defined in the previous step.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1482\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="259" height\="142">
		9. The “**Load**” Step creates a barcode file in TXT format under the specified pathname (step 7\). The file will be formatted (Step 13\) after the carrier has been loaded. To use this step, its library must be included first. To do this, follow the steps below:
		10. Add the library “**HSLML\_STARlib.hsl**” to be able to use the “**FormatBarcodeFile**” Command.
		11. Also add the “**HSLTrcLib.hsl**” to be able to trace data.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1483\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="351" height\="244">
		12. Fill out the “**FormatBarcodeFile**” Dialog: the instrument and the two files must be used as parameters. A return value is not needed.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1484\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="375" height\="234">
		13. Note that the “**BarcodeFileExcel**” Variable must be handed over.
		14. The next step is to open the formatted file. Because only the tube barcodes are of interest, the information in the file has to be filtered. SQL (Structured Query Language) offers a lot of these filter and sorting options. For more explanation, open Help of the “**FileOpen**” Step.
		
		  
		
		
		Example
		
		A filter string has to be defined. This is done in step 15 as shown in the snapshot below.
		
		"**SELECT \* FROM \[Sheet1$] WHERE \[Barcode] NOT LIKE 'No barcode' AND \[Specifier] NOT LIKE 'C'**"
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1485\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="605" height\="30">
		
		  
		
		
		This means that the Excel file is opened using two filters:
		
		
			* All “**No barcode**” Entries (which is the code for an empty carrier position) are not shown
			* All Entries with “**C**” in the “**Specifier**” Column are not shown (this is the carrier barcode)
		1. In the “**File Open**”, the name of the Excel file and all the columns have to be passed. For “**File name**”, use the variable specified in the header. For “**Sheet name**”, use “**Barcodes1$**”. The $ sign is needed to be able to read from the file.
		2. Set the “**File handle**” to “**formattedExcel**”. Giving a name makes it easier to find and use (e.g. of several files).
		3. Set the mode to “**File Open to Read**”.
		4. Then, type in all the columns that appear in the file to be opened. Please note that the column name has to be enclosed in quotation marks. Link this name to a Read/Write variable and set its type. As seen below, all columns are of type String except the “**Id**”. This one is an integer.
		5. Finally, select the variable for the SQL Filter query in the “**Command string**” Field.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1486\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="284" height\="315">
		6. Click **\[OK]** to close the “**File Open**” Step.
		7. Add a loop and iterate over file1\. This means that the loop will be executed until ”**formattedExcel**” ends.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1487\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="501" height\="81">
		8. In the loop, the data is read by a File read from the General Steps using the file handle **Excel file1** to include the information in the trace file (**C:\\programm file\\ HAMILTON\\LogFiles**).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1488\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="427" height\="267">
		9. The Data in line 1 and 3 are in quotation marks. Therefore, they are displayed as text. Line 2 and 4 will show the variable’s value at run time. The result of this will be an entry for each valid barcode, as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1489\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="525" height\="20">
		10. This is done for each entry in the file that matches the restrictions in the SQL statement.
		11. The result of the second part of the method should look like this:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1490\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="497" height\="403">
		12. The file is closed in step 24\.
		13. Steps 25 and 26 will delete both the system created BarcodeTextFile and the formatted BarcodeExcelFile. To do this, use the DeleteFile command from the HSLMappingReport library.
		14. The newly created local sub\-method is now ready.

		1. ### ‌Using the Sub\-Method in the Main Method‌
		
		  
		
		
		This sub\-method can be used as the next step in the main method.
		
		
			1. Select the "**Main Method**" Tab and drag the “**Sub\-method**” Icon into the main\-method.
			2. The following dialog opens and the parameter list has to be supplied as shown on the next page.

3. ‌Liquid Handling (Pipetting)‌
========

This section describes the process of pipetting liquids using the ML STAR instruments.

Definition

Pipetting means the transfer of (small or large) quantities of liquid from one container to another. A pipetting operation is achieved through the following:


	* Tip or needle pickup
	* Aspirating liquid from a source container
	* Dispensing it into a target container
	* Tip or needle eject  



	1. ‌The Air Displacement Principle‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1494\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="55" height\="394">
	
	The ML STAR is based on the air displacement pipetting principle, comparable to the work principle of handheld pipettes.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1495\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="97" height\="346">
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1496\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="15" height\="182">
	
	Plunger Barrel
	
	Tip
	
	Air
	
	  
	
	
	Liquid
	
	  
	
	
	Air displacement means that the liquid is aspirated into and dispensed from a disposable tip or needle by the movement of a plunger. There is air between the plunger and the liquid surface. No system liquid of any kind is involved in the ML STAR. On the ML STAR, the pipetting of volumes from 0\.5µl up to 5ml are processed. Filter tips can be used to avoid contamination by aerosol.
	2. ‌From Aspiration to Dispense‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	This section describes the processes involved in a simple pipetting step. These phases are:
	
	
		* Movement to pick\-up position
		* Tip pick\-up
		* Movement to source position
		* Aspiration
		* Movement to target position
		* Dispense
		* Movement to drop\-off position and
		* Tip drop\-offAlthough they are also important, the movement phases are not described in details here.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Tip Pick\-Up‌
		
		  
		
		
		The first task of the ML STAR is to pick up a disposable tip or a reusable steel needle.
		
		For disposable tips, special carriers (typically holding 5 tip racks of 96 tips each) are placed on the instrument deck.
		
		Steel needles can be picked up directly from the wash station or from a separate needle rack.
		
		The tip pick\-up of the individual pipetting channels can happen simultaneously or one by one, as specified by the programmer.
		2. ### ‌Aspiration‌
		
		  
		
		
		Blow out air
		
		The first step within an aspiration and dispense cycle is to aspirate a variable amount of “**blow\-out**” air, which is used at the end of the (last) dispense, to blow all the liquid out of the tip. This is done with the tips still in the air.
		
		  
		
		
		Aspirate position
		
		The most important condition for a successful aspiration is to make sure that the tip dips into the liquid. Another important point is to prevent the tip from withdrawing from the liquid during the complete aspiration step.
		
		To make a good contact between the tip and the liquid, three positioning modes are available:
		
		
			* Moving the tip to a fixed height: For this, the exact height of the liquid surface has to be known in advance.
			* Using the capacitive Liquid Level Detection (cLLD): For conductive liquids, capacitive LLD should be used. Please make sure conductive (black) tips are used.
			* Using the pressure Liquid Level Detection (pLLD): For non\-conductive liquids, or in case of an insufficient electrical coupling between container bottom and carrier, pressure LLD should be used.<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1497\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The capacitive Liquid Level Detection is available on the 1000μl\- and 5ml\- pipetting channels, the CO\-RE 96, the CO\-RE 96 TADM and the CO\-RE 384 Probe Head. The pressure LLD is only available on the 1000μl\-pipetting channels and 5ml\-pipetting channels.
		
		  
		
		
		Fixed height
		
		[For the fixed height, a value must be chosen which ensures that the tip is permanently below the liquid level. The programmer must prevent aspiration of air instead of liquid. See](#bookmark410) [Following](#bookmark410) theLiquid Level below.
		
		  
		
		
		Liquid Level Detection, LLD
		
		Vigorously and with more care, the liquid level of the vessel to be aspirated from can be detected. This can be provided by the Microlab STAR Liquid Level Detection (LLD) feature based on either capacitive (cLLD) or pressure (pLLD) signal detection.
		
		  
		
		
		Capacitive Liquid Level Detection, cLLD
		
		If conductive liquids are to be pipetted, Hamilton recommends using the advantage of the capacitive LLD. The sensitivity of the capacitive LLD that is to be used depends on the vessel size and the conductivity (or polarity) of the liquid that is to be detected. For a solution of 0\.1% NaCl in distilled water, the required sensitivities are:
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		| cLLDsetting | Sensitivity level | Vessel |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| 1 | Very High | 384\-well plates |
		| 2 | High | 96\-well round\-bottom plates |
		| 3 | Medium | 96\-well flat\-bottom plates |
		| 4 | Low | Tubes, reagent reservoirs or any other large vessels |
		
		  
		
		
		The following table gives the minimum volume a single pipetting channel can detect in various containers for the capacitive Liquid Level Detection.
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		| Labware | Vmin \[µl] | Carrier |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| Tubes, 16 mm x 100 mm | 200 | SMP\_CAR\_24 |
		| Tubes, 12 mm x 75 mm | 150 | SMP\_CAR\_32 |
		| Eppendorf tubes 1\.5 ml | 50 | SMP\_CAR\_32\_EPIL |
		| Eppendorf tubes 0\.5 ml | 50 | SMP\_CAR\_32\_EPIS |
		| 96\-well PCR plate | 50 | PLT\_CAR\_L5PCR |
		| 96\-well flat\-bottom microplate | 75 | PLT\_CAR\_L5MD |
		| 384\-well flat\-bottom microplate | 50 | PLT\_CAR\_L5MD |
		| 96\-deep well microplate (archive) | 150 | PLT\_CAR\_L5AC |
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1498\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		Using an ionic buffer in the assay in place of distilled water may help to overcome Liquid Level Detection problems.
		
		Use only original Hamilton labware carriers, disposables or needles. For a proper capacitive Liquid Level Detection, a sufficient conductive coupling of carrier and labware (tubes or microplates) is crucial.
		
		  
		
		
		Pressure Liquid Level Detection, pLLD
		
		When pipetting non\-conductive liquids or in the case of an insufficient electrical coupling between the container bottom and the carrier, Hamilton recommends to use the advantage of pressure LLD.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1499\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		Pressure LLD only works with new and empty tips. The suitable settings depend on the tip size and on the type of liquid.
		
		  
		
		
		Settings available for example, the 1000µl\-pipetting channels:
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		| pLLD Setting | Sensitivity level | Tip | Liquid |
		| --- | --- | --- | --- |
		| 1 | Very High | Standard | Low boiling point, low viscosity |
		| 2 | High | High | Low boiling point, low viscosity |
		| 3 | Medium | Standard | Water or higher viscosity |
		| 4 | Low | High | Water or higher viscosity |
		
		In the case of aspiration from foaming liquids, capacitive Liquid Level Detection in particular may not detect the surface properly. As an alternative, try pressure LLD, or a combination of both. If a combination of both LLD types is used, the maximum height difference between the two independent LLDs can be used as a parameter.
		
		  
		
		
		Submerge Depth
		
		Once the liquid surface is detected, an additional immersion depth of 2mm (specified by default) is used to prevent the aspiration of air.
		
		  
		
		
		‌Following the Liquid Level
		
		The tip follows the decreasing liquid level (specified by default) according to the aspirated volume. The distance covered while following the liquid level is computed from the known geometry of the liquid container.
		
		  
		
		
		Swap Speed
		
		In order to prevent droplets at the tip/needle orifice, the pipetting channel is moving at a slow speed out of the liquid.
		
		Transport Air
		
		After pulling out of the liquid and before moving to the target container, a variable amount of transport air is aspirated to prevent droplet formation.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1500\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="63" height\="324">
		
		At the end of an aspiration step the situation in the tip is as shown below.
		
		  
		
		
		Air of the system
		
		  
		
		
		Blow out air
		
		  
		
		
		Liquid Transport air
		
		  
		
		
		When using a fixed height aspiration (or dispense), the position of the transport air intake can be defined by the parameter “**Retract distance for transport air**”. Using this value makes sure that the tip’s end is out of liquid before aspirating the transport air.

		3. ### ‌Dispense‌
		
		  
		
		
		At the end of the aspiration step, transport air has been aspirated. The first step of the dispensing procedure is to search for the liquid surface or to move to a fixed height.
		
		Dispensing of the liquid may occur with three different modes:
		
		
			* Either onto/into a (liquid) surface
			* In a free jet

			* In order to ensure that the specified accuracy is achieved, volumes below 20µl should always be dispensed onto or into a (liquid) surface. For dispensing at liquid surface, use cLLD to detect the position of the surface and then dispense while following the rising liquid level.
			* When the liquid level is known, dispensing from a fixed height while following the rising liquid level is also possible.
			* For volumes larger than 20µl, the liquid can be dispensed in a jet without touching the surface. To dispense in a jet, specify a position a few millimeters above the surface and dispense following the rising liquid level. For dispensing in a jet low volume, a varying amount of blow\- out air is used to make sure that all liquid is dispensed from the tip.
			* If only a part of the liquid is dispensed with the jet mode, a stop back volume can be aspirated at the end of the dispense action. This will improve the droplet cut\-off at the end of each dispense. In the last step of the dispense procedure, before any x\- or y\-movement occurs, a variable amount of transport air is aspirated to prevent droplet formation. The transport air is aspirated with the tip above the liquid surface.<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1503\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="356" height\="338">

		4. ### ‌Tip Eject‌
		
		  
		
		
		Ejecting the used tip into the waste container of the ML STAR is the final step. A used needle will be returned to the wash station, where the wash process can be started directly.
		5. ### ‌Avoiding Contamination‌
		
		  
		
		
		If cross\-contamination is a concern, consider the following approaches:
		
		
			* Use only Hamilton tips on the ML STAR.
			* Use new tips for every pipetting step, to avoid carry\-over between different wells or containers.
			* Use filter tips in order to avoid contamination of the pipetting channel by jets, aerosols, etc.
			* Dispense any compounds at risk for cross\-contamination onto a surface. Dispensing in a jet may produce aerosols and thus can cause cross\-contamination.Dispense using a residual volume, i.e. do not completely empty the tip on dispense. This can be achieved e.g. by aspirating 11µl and dispensing only 10µl.
		6. ### ‌Touch Off‌
		
		  
		
		
		The “**Touch off**” Function is used if very small amounts of liquid shall be aspirated or dispensed into a manually placed labware or labware with great tolerances. The “**Touch off**” Function will move to a certain height over the well bottom and smoothly move downwards. As soon as the tip hits the bottom of the container, the motor current of the z\-drive increases. This change will be detected and the z\-move stops. From that position, the pipetting channels moves back up the specified distance “**Dispense position above touch**” and starts dispensing.

		7. ### ‌Side Touch‌
		
		  
		
		
		For a small amount of liquid, there is the possibility of dispensing liquid to the side of the well with the “**Side touch**” Mode (available in the Single Steps / Easy Steps).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1508\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="338" height\="176">
		
		  
		
		
		The “**Side touch**” Mode will move the tip to a specified height in the center of the container, and then moves right (always right). At this position, the dispensing of the liquid starts.
		
		The values for “**Touch off height**” and “**Right**” move have to be defined in the container data in the Labware Editor.

	3. ‌Liquid Classes, Pipetting Modes and More‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	Pipetting
	
	In general, pipetting by the principle of air displacement (as with handheld pipettes) is sensitive to the following:
	
	
		* Manner of pipetting (i.e. surface or jet, empty tip or part volume)
		* Tip or needle type (geometry, tip orifice)
		* Environmental effects (temperature, pressure, humidity)
		* Liquid type (viscosity, evaporation)The pipetting mode (e.g., surface or jet mode) and the liquid class determine the behavior of the instrument. Pipetting mode and liquid class represent two independent sets of information, both of which have to be specified.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1510\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Always use the same liquid class for one aspiration and dispense cycle. Otherwise uncalculated residual volumes may be left within the tip, or other errors regarding plunger position / movements may occur.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Aspiration‌
		
		  
		
		
		For aspiration, three modes are available:
		
		
			* “**Aspiration**”, for all standard cases.
			* “**Consecutive Aspiration**” for aspiration with a tip that has already aspirated liquid (e.g. if aspirating out of three different containers before the dispense step).
			* “**Aspirate All**” for aspiration of all the liquid in a container (specify a volume larger than what is expected to be in the container). In this case, aspiration monitoring is deactivated and the tip will follow the falling liquid level (if specified) to the bottom of the container, staying there for the rest of the aspiration.
		2. ### ‌Dispense‌
		
		  
		
		
		For dispense, five modes are available:
		
		
			* “**Surface Part Volume**” for dispensing only a part of the liquid in the tip to a surface, leaving a residual volume in the tip,
			* “**Surface Empty Tip**” for dispensing all the liquid in the tip to a surface,
			* “**Jet Part Volume**” for dispensing only a part of the liquid in the tip in a jet, i.e. without touching a surface, leaving a residual volume in the tip,
			* “**Jet Dispense Empty Tip**” for dispensing all the liquid in the tip in a jet.
			* “**Drain tip in Jet mode**”The liquid class stores all relevant background parameters, such as flow rates and volume corrections for one pipetting cycle, (i.e. for one aspiration and the subsequent dispense(s)). Depending on the pipetting mode chosen, only a subset of the parameters of the liquid class is active. According to the different dependencies listed above, liquid classes have attributes related to their intended use: tip type, liquid name, and dispense mode.
		
		[Different liquid classes are provided with the VENUS Software. They are optimized for different liquids, tip types, and important pipetting processes, such as aspiration followed by dispensing either to a surface or in a jet. Hamilton has optimized the standard liquid classes with great care to assure the best pipetting accuracy. To change Hamilton standard liquid classes, store the class under a different name first. For special applications, the programmer can define a liquid class to achieve the highest accuracy with the compounds and volumes of interest. The liquid classes can be adapted to the user\-specific requirements. For this purpose a liquid editor comes with the VENUS Software. It is described in](#bookmark424) [Section 13\.4 The Hamilton CO\-RE Liquid Editor](#bookmark424)[.](#bookmark424)
		3. ### ‌Liquid Handling Examples‌
		
		  
		
		
		Here are some examples of typically used combinations of liquid classes and pipetting modes:
		
		
			1. Aspirate 50µl of a water\-like liquid, dispense 50µl into an empty 96\-well plate; use standard tips; change tips every cycle.
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Liquid Class: | StandardVolume\_Water\_DispenseJet\_Empty |
			| --- | --- |
			| Aspiration Mode: | Aspiration |
			| Dispense Mode: | Jet Dispense Empty Tip |
			| Detection: | Aspiration: LLD \= pressure or capacitance or both, submerge to a depth of 2mm, following liquid level |
			| Dispense: | Fixed height of 5mm, not following liquid level |
			2. Aspirate a water\-like liquid, single dispense into a pre\-filled 96\-well plate; use low volume tips; change tips every cycle.
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Liquid Class: | LowVolume\_Water\_DispenseSurface\_Empty |
			| --- | --- |
			| Aspiration Mode: | Aspiration |
			| Dispense Mode: | Surface Dispense Empty Tip (in the liquid class selected here, the blow\- out volume is 0\) |
			| Detection: | Aspiration: LLD \= pressure or capacitance or both, submerge depth 2mm, following liquid level |
			| Dispense: | Capacitive LLD on, following liquid level |
			3. Aspirate ≥20µl of a water\-like liquid, dispense the same amount into an empty 96\-well plate; keep tips.
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Liquid Class: | StandardVolume\_Water\_DispenseJet\_Empty |
			| --- | --- |
			| Aspiration Mode: | Aspiration |
			| Dispense Mode: | Jet Dispense Empty Tip (Empty Tip only) |
			| Detection: | Aspiration: Capacitive LLD, submerge depth 2mm, following liquid level |
			| Dispense: | Fixed height of 5mm, not following liquid level |
			| Comment: | On first aspiration, pre\-wetting of the tip by 1\-3 mixing cycles is necessary to equalize conditions for initial and subsequent dispenses. |
			4. Aliquoting of liquid means aspirating a given volume at once and dispensing several partial volumes (aliquots) in a jet to different containers. In this frequently used pipetting procedure, the accuracy of the first and the last aliquot are often not within the specified range. Therefore, in order to dispense e.g. 10 aliquots of 20µl of a water\-like liquid with the ML STAR, aspirate 240µl and dispense 20µl directly back into the container. This is followed by dispensing 10 aliquots of 20µl each. The last aliquot of 20µl is discarded to another container or ejected with the tip. In addition, after dispensing of every aliquot, a given amount of air is aspirated and dispensed with the next aliquot.
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Liquid Class: | StandardVolumeWaterAliquotJet |
			| --- | --- |
			| Aspiration Mode: | Aspiration |
			| Dispense Mode: | Jet Dispense part volume |
			| Detection: | Aspiration: capacitive LLD, submerge depth 2mm, following liquid level |
			| Dispense: | Fixed height of 5mm, not following liquid level |
			5. Table of Aliquots

		| V(main aliq.): | Volume of main aliquot |
		| V(pre\-aliq.): | Volume of pre\-aliquot |
		| V(post\-aliq.): | Volume of post\-aliquot |
		| CV: | Precision (coefficient of variation, for definition see the Technical Specifications in the Microlab STAR Line Operator’s Manual) |

		The dispense mode for all cases is “**Jet Dispense, Part Volume**“.
		
		The following table shows accuracy of aliquoting volumes in dependency upon various pipetting parameters. Sample values and results for pre\- and post\-aliquot volumes are listed. Please note that the examples for water\* and the following are not technical specifications:

		\*Other liquids data is available upon request. Please ask a Hamilton Representative for further information.
		4. ### ‌Anti\-Droplet Control (ADC)‌
		
		  
		
		
		The Anti\-Droplet Control (ADC) function offers a way to prevent droplet formation at the tip of tips or needles while pipetting highly volatile liquids.
		
		These liquids cause droplets because the high vapor pressure of the volatile solvents (e.g. acetone, ethanol, diethyl ether) results in a pressure increase in the tip. This pressure will push the liquid out of the tip (fig A and B).
		
		The working principle of ADC is to measure the pressure inside the pipetting channel (with the built\-in pressure sensor) and compensate the increasing pressure by moving the piston upwards. The evaporated volume of the liquid will now be compensated.

		Anti\-droplet control (ADC)
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1512\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
		
		ATTENTION
		
		The following statements will help in order to get best pipetting results using ADC:
		
		Use ADC only for pipetting steps where a change of pressure inside the tip is expected (e.g. if using a liquid with high vapor pressure).
		
		The air transport volume should be very small or zero. If necessary, create a new liquid class.
		
		The swap speed should be slow. If necessary, create a new liquid class.
		
		Keep in mind that the piston may not be in its initial position when tips are reused without ejecting. ADC might not be working after several steps.
		
		ADC can be switched on using the appropriate steps from “**HSLStarLib.hsl**”. ADC works on both pipetting channel types, 1000μl and 5ml.
		5. ### ‌Monitored Air Displacement (MAD)‌
		
		  
		
		
		The ML STAR is equipped with an aspiration monitoring feature. During the aspiration process, the pressure within the pipetting channel is measured in real time. Analyzing the shape of the p(t) curve, the system can distinguish the following situations:
		
		
			* A correct aspiration takes place
			* Air is aspirated into the tip (because, for example, the container has not been filled properly)
			* A clot blocks the tip  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1513\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		MAD is available on the 1000μl\-pipetting channels and the 5ml\-pipetting channels.
		
		  
		
		
		The aspiration monitoring can be switched on and off for each individual aspiration step of a method using the steps from “**HLSMl\_StarLib.hsl**”. For pressure\-based clot detection, a threshold can be given in arbitrary A/D (analog/digital) values (typically 100 A/D values). The range of A/D values of the pressure sensor is from around 800 (at ambient pressure) to \<10 A/D values for 18 mbar below ambient pressure. For comparison, the hydrostatic pressure of 100µl of water in our standard tip is around 2 mbar.
		
		The following diagram shows the principle of aspiration monitoring based on pressure.

		Aspiration monitoring based on pressure
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1515\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		Pressure\-based monitoring works with unused as well as used disposable tips and needles.
		
		If multiple Aspirate/Dispense cycles are executed within a loop, make sure that the (last) dispense step uses the Pipetting mode ‘Drain tip’.
		
		The volume range for the MAD depends on the specific assay. The lower limit in many cases is an aspiration volume of 50µl.
		
		Pressure\-based monitoring has been optimized for liquid solutions only.
		6. ### ‌Capacitance\-based Clot Detection‌
		
		  
		
		
		In addition to pressure\-based clot detection, the ML STAR is equipped with capacitance\-based clot detection. This detection approach works when the aspiration with capacitance Liquid Level Detection is switched on.
		
		  
		
		
		Functionality
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1516\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="49" height\="241">
		
		The system measures the conductive signal when the tip leaves the liquid after aspiration. Due to the air gap between tip and liquid, the capacitance signal will vanish once a given height is reached (the “**Clot retract height**”, which is specified within the liquid class). If a clot is present, it bridges the distance and the signal will remain, resulting in an error message. A typical clot retract height is 2\-5 mm, as illustrated below. This clot detection is independent from pressure\-based monitoring.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1517\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="8" height\="48"> Clot retract height
		
		  
		
		
		The capacitance\-based clot detection is only valid, if the liquid parameter “**Clot retract height**[” is set (\>0\). Refer to](#bookmark424) Section 13\.4 The Hamilton CO\-RE Liquid Editor.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1518\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The capacitance\-based clot detection is available on the 1000μl\-pipetting channels and the 5ml\-pipetting channels.
		7. ### ‌TADM – Total Aspiration and Dispensing Monitoring‌
		
		  
		
		
		TADM (Total Aspiration and Dispensing Monitoring) is a tool to increase the safety and the robustness of pipetting processes. However, it is not part of the standard software package.
		
		The Principle of TADM
		
		The pressure inside each individual pipetting channel is constantly recorded during aspiration and dispensing. The values obtained by the pressure sensor during a pipetting step (aspiration or dispensing) can be compared to values defined by the user. This allows real\-time monitoring of the pipetting process.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1519\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="359" height\="219">
		
		The differences between error\-free pipetting steps and erroneous ones are used to distinguish the results of the pipetting steps. Basically, there are two types of errors that can be detected:
		
		
			* Pressure above normal (overpressure)
			* Pressure below normal (underpressure)TADM verifies that a sample has been transferred with a traceable digital audit trail which is particularly beneficial for *In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD)* laboratories.
		
		Peaks and fraying of TADM curves can be a sign that the liquid class and / or the pipetting process are not defined in a precise and robust way. With the help of TADM, the pipetting process can thus be optimized and made more robust.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1520\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		TADM is available on the 1000μl\-pipetting channels, 5ml\-pipetting channels and on the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head TADM. The CO\-RE 96 Probe Head TADM is now provided standard for the ML STAR with Multi Probe Head 96\.
		
		The TADM features are available only after purchase and installation of the TADM software package.
		
		With VENUS M Software, the TADM test aspiration pressure curves are analysed to indicate pipetting performance.

	-------
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Concept of Liquid Classes‌
		
		  
		
		
		Liquid classes manage the background parameters for pipetting.
		
		Definition
		
		A liquid class is a set of parameters determining the aspiration and dispensing behavior of the pipette appropriate for a given liquid, tip type, and dispense mode. For all aspiration and dispense steps a valid liquid class must be selected.
		
		Predefined liquid classes
		
		Several predefined liquid classes are supplied along with the VENUS Software for the following liquids: water, DMSO, glycerin, acetonitrile, ethanol, plasma and serum. The standard liquid classes cover a wide range of applications, and there will probably be no need to make any changes of the parameter settings to adapt the liquid class to a specific application.
		
		Custom liquid classes
		
		For special applications, a liquid class can be custom\-defined. This custom liquid class can be used just like the predefined classes.
		
		Defining liquid classes independent from a method serves to simplify the steps in the method and allows the complete set of parameters to be defined once for all pipetting tasks.
		
		The liquid editor is used to display the parameters of the liquid classes and to create custom liquid classes.
		2. ### ‌Editing Liquid Details‌

			Liquid Details
			
			The “**Liquid Details**” Tab has two sections. In the image on the previous page, the following attributes of the liquid class are shown:
			
			
				* Liquid device
				* Liquid (name)
				* Tip (or needle) type
				* Dispense mode.
				
				The image below shows the parameters of a liquid class:
				
				  
				
				
				<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1527\).gif" alt\="PM\_361\_liquid\_parameters" data\-size\="original" width\="471" height\="358">
				
				  
				
				
				Liquid Parameters
				
				The liquid parameters section shows the appropriate instrument parameters for aspirating and dispensing.
				
				Here is what the various parameters mean:
				* “Flow Rate” and “Mix Flow Rate” are volume flows of liquid in µl/s; they correspond to plunger speeds for aspirating, dispensing and mixing.
				* “Air Transport Volume”: air for transport is aspirated at the end of the aspirate and/or dispense step and automatically dispensed again as an extra volume in the first part of the dispense step.
				* “Blowout Volume”: blow\-out air is taken up first during aspiration. If dispensing will later be done using the “Empty tip” Dispense Mode, the entire volume including blow\-out air is dispensed in the dispense step.
				* “Swap Speed” is the speed at which the dispensing head (single pipetting channel, CO\-RE 96 Probe Head or CO\-RE 384 Probe Head) is drawn up out of the liquid.
				* “Settling Time” is the time the dispensing head has to wait in the liquid after aspiration/dispense until it begins to withdraw.
				* “Over\-Aspirate Volume” is a kind of pre\-wetting volume: on aspirating e.g. 20µl of liquid, first more than 20µl is aspirated (20µl \+ Over\-asp. vol.), so as to pre\-wet the tip. Then this volume is dispensed again immediately (still in the aspirate step).
				* “Clot Retract Height”: a parameter for recognizing clots which determines how high the dispensing head is allowed to travel up out of the liquid if there is a residual cLLD signal after aspiration. It is measured in mm from the height of the liquid surface upwards. If this distance is exceeded, an error message is generated.
				* “Stop Flow Rate”: dispensing speed of the plunger (expressed as a stream of liquid volume in µl/s), at which the dispense step terminates abruptly. If the “Dispense flow rate“ is equal to the “Stop flow rate“, the dispense breaks off abruptly after dispensing the volume without slowing down beforehand. If the “Stop flow rate“ is set to its minimum permitted value, the plunger movement becomes gradually slower during the dispense until it stops.
				* “Stop Back Volume”: volume which is aspirated again immediately after dispensing “Jet Part Volume” Mode. This volume is aspirated automatically as quickly as possible in order to have a cut\-off of the liquid flow.
				* “Pressure LLD Sensitivity”: Default value for the pressure LLD sensitivity to be used in aspiration steps. Determined by the liquid.
				* “Max Height Difference”: Default tolerated maximum height difference in mm between pressure and capacitive LLD if both are activated during aspiration.

			3. A correction curve shows a target volume and a corrected volume.Target Volume
		
		The “**Target volume**“ is the volume to be dispensed (the one entered in the pipetting steps).
		
		Corrected Volume
		
		The “**Corrected volume**“ is the volume that actually needs to be moved by the plunger for this purpose. In aspiration or dispense steps, the “**Target volume**“ which will actually be dispensed into the vessel must be entered. Corrected volumes for a desired target volume are usually determined gravimetrically.
		
		Correspondingly, a corrected volume of 107\.2µl for a target volume of 100µl does not mean that 107\.2µl of liquid will be dispensed. When the tip is emptied, 100µl are dispensed. The correction is mainly due to the properties of the air column above the liquid.
		
		The high flexibility of the liquid classes allows pipetting any liquid with high accuracy. Custom liquid classes are also available upon request from Hamilton’s Application Engineering Group for the customer specified applications.

		4. ### ‌Process Control‌
		
		  
		
		
		For additional process control of the pipetting steps, the monitoring functions can be switched on and off for a single pipetting step or for a specific part of the method. The commands for the Monitored Air Displacement (MAD) and the Capacitive Clot Detection are functions of the library “HSLML\_STARLib”. To make the commands available, link the library to the method. Add the library to the method through the "Method  Libraries...[" Menu (refer to](#bookmark324) [Section](#bookmark324) 11\.12\.10[ML STAR Library](#bookmark324)[.](#bookmark324)

		5. ### ‌Using Smart Steps‌
		
		  
		
		
		In this section, the general features of the "**Pipette**" Smart Step are explained by means of the “**Simple Pipetting**” Smart Step (the other variants of the “**Pipette**[” Command have similar wizards). More examples can be found in](#bookmark360) Section 12 Demo Methods for the ML STAR.
		
		
			1. Drag one of the "**Pipette**" Smart Steps into the method window. The corresponding step of the "**Pipette**" Smart Step Wizard opens:
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1594\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="405" height\="443">
			2. Use the drop down list to identify the instrument on which pipetting must be performed, as well as the aspirate and dispense sequences.
			3. Note that the sequences can also be indicated using arrays:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1595\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="405" height\="282">
			4. Click the **\[Next \>]** Button. The next page of the pipetting wizard will be activated.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1596\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="334" height\="413">
			5. Note that in this dialog the volume can also be specified using an array as shown below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1597\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="329" height\="407">
			6. Define: the **volume(s)** for the pipetting process, a possible rest volume and its re\-dispense target.
			7. If a volume for “**Simple**“, “**Replica**” or “**Pooling**” is specified and exceeds the volume of the tip, multiple transfers with equally divided volumes will be performed automatically.Rest Volume
		
		A residual volume “**Rest volume**” in the dialogs may be used for all pipetting modes too. This is handled at the end of a pipetting step after the (last) dispensing step. In the aliquot mode the additional handled residual volume is called “**Post\-aliquot**” in contrast to the “**Pre\-aliquot**”, which is handled before the aspirating step. The pre\-aliquot is dispensed back into the aspiration sequence.
		
		With the “**Rest volume**”, the choice is to discard it back into the aspiration sequence, or to dispense it into the waste container. In the previous example, a re\-dispense height counted from the bottom of the container has to be given.
		
		
			1. Click the **\[Next \>]** Button. The following pipetting wizard dialog will be displayed.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1598\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="339" height\="419">
			2. Select the appropriate tip/needle handling which is the same for all dispense modes:
			3. First, select the tip sequence \- where the tips are to be picked up from (here, an array can also be selected). The tip type is automatically retrieved from the sequence. If the tip sequence is used up, it will be automatically reloaded. As an additional feature, the tip sequence can be reduced during a reload.
			4. Tip/needle handling can be specified, too (some items may not be selected, depending on the pipetting mode):
			
			
				* Replace tips “**After each dispense**“ (if multiple dispenses are needed to transfer e.g. 900
				
				µl with a standard tip of 300 µl),
				* Only for replicas (and pooling) the option “**After transferred volume**“ becomes active. This allows the use of fresh tips even for multiple aspirations and multiple dispense cycles being performed with the same sample.
				* “**After each sample**“ (multiple dispenses of the same sample are done with the same tip),
				* With “**One tip set**“, **or**
				* Without tip handling, “**Never**“. In this case, ML STAR will have to pick up tips prior to the pipette step and eject them after pipetting, using single steps.
			5. A **tip counter** can be specified, which enables the user to start with a set of tips, partly used in previous runs at the correct position. To read a tip counter, it can be specified within the Smart Step “**Load**” (see corresponding section). A tip counter is specified by a name (e.g., “**cntTips**“). Be reminded to enclose the name in quotation marks.
			6. Within the “**Pipette**” Smart Step, the current position of the tip sequence will continuously be stored under the name of the tip counter. Note that a tip counter has to be initialized if it is to be read by the “**Load**” Smart Step within the next run.
			7. Click the **\[Next \>]** Button. The next page of the pipetting wizard will be displayed.

		Sequence handling for Aliquot procedure
		
		In the case of aliquoting, the dispense sequence is always the controlling sequence.
		
		  
		
		
		Sequence Handling in Pipetting Mode “Simple”
		
		Consider a situation where the aspiration sequence comprises 8 tubes, and the dispense sequence is a 96\-well plate. What should be done now with the 88 remaining positions within the plate? If the aspiration sequence is controlling, the dispense sequence is reduced to the length of the aspiration sequence and the pipetting stops after dispensing into the first 8 positions of the plate sequence. If the dispense sequence is controlling, the aspiration sequence will be repeated until it reaches the length of the dispense sequence. This results in multiple transfers (12 for an 8\- channel instrument) from the same 8 tubes to fill the complete plate. Then the (controlling) dispense sequence is finished and pipetting stops.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1604\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The “**Pipette**” Smart Step always equalizes the length of aspiration and dispense sequences.
		
		  
		
		
		The following table gives an overview of the different situations and examples.
		
		  
		
		
		
		
		|  | Aspiration sequence is GREATER THANdispense sequence | Aspiration sequence is SMALLER THANdispense sequence |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| Aspiration Controls | [The dispense sequence is REPEATED to the length of aspiration sequence (see](#bookmark435) [Case](#bookmark435) 1)Examples for use: | [The dispense sequence is REDUCED to the length of the aspiration sequence (see](#bookmark437) [Case](#bookmark437) 3)Example for use:\- Transfer a variable number (\<96\) of tubes into a 96\-well plate (left partly filled). |
		| Dispensation Controls | [The aspiration sequence is REDUCED to the length of the dispense sequence (see](#bookmark436) [Case](#bookmark436) 2)Examples for use: | [The aspiration sequence is REPEATED to the length of dispense sequence (see](#bookmark438) Case 4)Examples for use: |
		
		
			* Copy 2 plates into 1 (after another)
			* With reloading of the dispense sequence: Transfer available tubes to as many plates as needed.
			* Transfers from many tubes to a plate and stops when plate is filled.
			* With reloading of plate sequences: Automatically fill as many plates as needed with liquid from tubes.
			* Transfer reagent from a container (or, e.g., 8 tubes) to a complete plate.
			* Copy tubes repeatedly into plate.
			* With reload of aspiration sequence: Automatically reload tubes until plate is filled.‌Case 1: Aspiration sequence \> dispense sequence, controlled by the aspiration sequence.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1605\).jpg" alt\="reload" data\-size\="original" width\="432" height\="285">
		
		  
		
		
		The target sequence is repeated to match the length of the source sequence.
		
		Another example for this case: All Tubes to Plate(s). This is a reloadable plate sequence used to load all tubes to as many plates as needed.
		
		  
		
		
		‌Case 2: Aspiration sequence \> dispense sequence. This case is controlled by the dispense sequence.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1606\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="311" height\="319">
		
		  
		
		
		The source sequence is cut to match the length of the target sequence, and stops when the plate is full (prepare plate for assay).
		
		‌Case 3: Dispense sequence \> aspiration sequence this case is controlled by the aspiration sequence
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1607\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="279" height\="300">

		The source sequence is repeated n\-times to match the length of the target sequence and stops when the plate is full (distribute buffer, reagents...). Also used for aliquoting.
	6. ‌Sequence Handling in Pipetting Mode Pooling and Replica‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	In these two cases, the aspiration sequence should be selected as controlling. It is possible to choose how to reload a sequence:
	
	
		* If during pipetting a sequence is used up (no more tubes are left to aspirate from), the system asks for a new carrier of tubes to be loaded.
		* If the “**Operator may reduce the sequence by a reload**“ Checkbox is ticked, the user has the option of reducing the newly loaded sequence at run time. This is especially helpful if the exact amount of sample tubes varies from run to run (or from tube carrier to tube carrier).
		
		  
		
		
		Advanced Buttons
		
		Sequence manipulations can be made (separately for aspiration and dispense sequences) by means of the dialogs invoked by the **\[Advanced...]** Buttons.
		* If the Smart Step is going to work with sequences that have been used within this method from the preceding steps, the sequence counters can be reset. This is done by using the two checkboxes for initial sequence manipulation.
		* If other steps are following this Smart Step, the status of the sequence which is passed back can be defined by the **\[Final sequence manipulation]** Radio Button. Below is an example of the advanced dialog for “**Aspirate**” Sequence settings.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1609\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="288" height\="243">
		
		  
		
		
		The “**Error Settings**” Dialog allows specifying an error handling approach. The choices are listed on the next page.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1610\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="288" height\="182">
		
		In case of an error, the following choices are:
		* Abort the method (only abort button on run time error dialog)
		* Offer choices (in run time) whether to **abort or cancel** (continue with user\-defined error handling if programmed, otherwise abort)
		* Use the fixed **default error recovery** (recommended) pre\-programmed for the Smart Step. In this case two choices can be made
		* “**Copy pattern**”, means that in case of an error on aspiration, the corresponding well of the dispense sequence will be left out (the pattern is kept). If “**Copy pattern**“ is not checked, the dispense sequence positions will all be pipetted, leaving a well not pipetted at the end of the sequence.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1611\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="445" height\="182">
		* “**Exclude error positions**”, means exclude the erroneous positions from aspiration and dispensation sequences. If this option is enabled and an error occurs during an aspirate or dispense step, the erroneous position will be excluded from the sequence by removing the corresponding element from the aspirate or dispense sequence. The next time these sequences are used, the erroneous well will not be pipetted.
		* In addition, **Walk\-away mode** can be enabled. If this checkbox is ticked, a timeout has to be specified after which the error dialog on run time will automatically close down and continue with the selected error handling: abort, cancel, or default error recovery.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1612\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Exception: If the option “**Default error recovery**” is chosen and an error occurs for which the default is set to abort (e.g. a hardware error), the walk\-away mode is left on and the dialog waits for user interaction.
	
	
		1. ### ‌Tip Pick Up and Tip Eject Smart Steps‌
		
		  
		
		
		These two Smart Steps allow picking up tips from a rack and then disposing them in the tip waste after use.
		
		Below is the dialog for the “**Tip Pick Up**” Step.

4. ‌Loading Labware‌
=================

There are two options to load labware on the deck: Autoload and manual load. In both cases, always have the needed carriers ready. The following table shows the possible course of action:

  




| Method contains “Load Carrier” Commands | Autoload Instrument | Manual Load Instrument |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | Run the method.Insert carriers in the tracks of the Autoload tray where indicated by LEDs.Click “**Load**” in the dialog.Possibility to manipulate sequences.Carriers are loaded automatically. | Run the method.The instrument will prompt a message to load the carriers manually onto the deck. |
| No | Load the carriers manually into their positions on the deck.Run the method. | Load the carriers manually into their positions on the deck.Run the method. |

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1615\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

If no “**Load carrier**” Commands are specified in the method, no checking of carrier presence is possible.


	1. ‌Autoload‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	When using the Autoload option, make sure to load the carriers with the appropriate labware first.
	
	  
	
	
	With “Load Carrier” Commands in the method
	
	
		1. If the “**Load Carrier**” Commands have been incorporated into the method: start the “**Run Screen**” as described in the following sections, and run the method.
		
		The correct positions for the insertion of carriers will be highlighted by the green LEDs.
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1616\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="630" height\="181">
		
		Autoload Tray

Stop Hooks

1. Insert the carriers into the tracks of the Autoload tray until they touch the stop hooks on the far side of the tray.

These pictures are made from the rear of the instrument.
2. Click **\[Load]** in the dialog.

The carriers are loaded onto the deck automatically by the “**Load Carrier**” Command in the method. At the same time, the barcodes of carriers and labware are read and stored in a file.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1617\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

If “**Sample Tracking**” is enabled (in the system configuration editor), the barcodes will be written to the Database.

  


Another way for loading is to place the carriers onto the defined positions of the Autoload tray before starting the method. Loading and barcode reading will then be performed without user input.

  


Without “Load Carrier” Commands in the method

1. If there have been no “**Load Carrier**” Commands incorporated into the method, the carriers must be loaded manually into the positions on the deck defined in the Deck Layout before the run is started.
2. Make sure that the carriers are inserted completely, until they touch the rear connectors.
1. ‌Manual Load‌
----

  


In order to load the ML STAR, fill the carriers with the appropriate labware first.

  


With “Load Carrier” Commands in the Method


	1. If the “**Load Carrier**” Commands have been incorporated into the method, start the run. The instrument will prompt a message to load the carriers manually onto the deck.
	2. Make sure the carriers are inserted completely, until they lock in the rear snaps. A magnetic sensor checks whether the carriers have been loaded correctly.

2. ‌Barcode Reading / Identification‌
------

  


Carriers, containers, racks and tip racks can be identified by a barcode. The reader device scanning the barcodes is mounted on the Autoload slide. The system must allow specification of ranges (barcode mask) for plausibility checking of barcode information.


	1. ### ‌Supported Barcode Types‌
	
	  
	
	
	The following bar code abbreviations can be read by the Autoload Option:
	
	
		* ISBT standard
		* Code 128 (subset B and C)
		* Code 39
		* Codabar
		* Code 2 of 5 Interleaved
		* UPC A/E
		* JAN/EAN8  
	
	
	The barcodes to be read can be enabled through the “Tools  System Configuration Editor 
	
	ML STAR” Menu section.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1630\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="560" height\="217">
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1631\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	Enable only barcode types which will be used on the system. Disabling the unused barcode types will improve the reliability of the readings.
	2. ### ‌Unique Barcodes‌
	
	  
	
	
	The unique barcode check controls if a barcode has already been used on the system. To use this function, four settings must be made:
	
	
		1. Activate sample tracking.
		2. Specify the unique barcode check mode.
		3. Specify the duration of the check period.
		4. Set the unique barcode flag on the desired labware positions.As soon as the unique barcode checking is set to “**Track only**” or “**Check and Track**”, all read barcodes will be written to the data base with a timestamp (when it was loaded).
	
	Every load step will now refer to this database and check if the barcode has been loaded during the specified check duration.
	
	  
	
	
	Activate Sample Tracking
	
	To use the Unique barcode check, Sample Tracking must be set to “ON” in the “System Configuration Editor  System Settings”:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1632\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="485" height\="208">
	
	  
	
	
	Specify the “**Unique Barcode check**” Mode:
	
	“OFF” Mode
	
	Unique barcode management is switched off. Meaning, no check for unique barcodes, no writing to the database will be done.
	
	“Track only” Mode
	
	Unique barcode check will be turned on partially. Barcodes and timestamp are added to the database to be checked in the future, but no checks are performed. If the barcode has been loaded previously, the timestamp will be updated. Meaning there will be writing but not checking of barcodes.
	
	“Check and Track” Mode
	
	Unique barcode check operation is fully turned on. If a barcode is presented a second time within the specified unique barcode duration, a warning is invoked that this barcode has been loaded previously. Meaning it will write at the same time check barcodes.
	
	Specify the Unique Barcode Duration
	
	Click the **\['...']** Button if unique barcode duration is selected, to open a wizard which allows specification of the duration parameter.
	
	
		* Current run: Barcodes must be unique within the current run.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1633\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="340" height\="128">
		* Time in hours: Duration in hours within a barcode must be unique.  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1634\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="340" height\="134">
	
	  
	
	
	Set the Unique Barcode Check Flag on the Labware:
	
	
		1. Open the Context Menu of the specified labware in the Deck Layout (right mouse\-click).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1635\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="586" height\="261">
		
		  
		
		
		To make the sample carrier barcode itself unique, tick the “**Barcode must be unique**” Checkbox underneath the barcode mask. Now, the carrier barcode will be controlled at every load step.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1636\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="350" height\="269">
		2. To set barcodes on the tubes as unique, select the **\[By Position…]** Tab.
		
		In the example shown below, there are two barcodes that should not be checked for distinction. Every barcode in position 1 and 2 is allowed to appear multiple times, but the barcode mask for these barcodes must be correct.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1637\).png" alt\="12\-12\-2012 14\-08\-11" data\-size\="original" width\="353" height\="375">
		3. All other positions are marked as “**Unique**” in the right most column. This will enable the checking for unique barcodes (as long as all other settings are appropriate).
		4. To mark all barcodes for checking, check the “**Barcode must be unique**” Checkbox. Select all positions and click the **\[Apply to selected positions]** Tab.Behavior at Runtime
	
	During runtime, two errors can be raised:
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| First load | Second Load | Error |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| Unique flag on Labware not set | Unique flag on Labware not set | No error |
	| Unique flag on Labware not set | Unique flag on Labware set | Barcode Not Unique Error |
	| Unique flag on Labware set | Unique flag on Labware set | Barcode Not Unique Error |
	| Unique flag on Labware set | Unique flag on Labware not set | Barcode Already Used Error |
	
	This table is true for “**Check and Track**” when activated within same run or within specified check unique barcode period or when presenting a barcode multiple times.
	
	Barcode Not Unique Error

Height for gripping is calculated from the upper rim of the plate. Recommended gripping height for MTP: 3 mm

Recommended gripping height for DWP: 13 mm

(an error will appear if there is an attempt to grip a Deep Well Plate with a grip height \< 10mm traverse height).

  


1. ### ‌Special iSWAP Features‌

  


Among the special features of iSWAP are:


	* A torque sensor which signals to the robot how tightly it is gripping a labware object.
	* The plates can be placed in landscape or portrait orientation.
	* Load and unload plates to and from a plate stacker on the left side of the instrument outside the working area (with some restrictions, this can also be done on the right side).
	* Handling plates 100mm below the deck (if iSWAP Rev. ≥ 03\. E.g. possible on the ML STARplus without deck extension).Not all features are available on the old iSwap Type.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1643\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

Gripping of microplates in landscape orientation is only possible with the Landscape iSWAP P/N 190220\.

Use the “**Hamilton System Configuration Editor**” to enable the functions of the “**Landscape**” iSWAP: ML STAR / Simulator configuration / iSWAP / “**Large Gripper**”.
2. ### ‌iSWAP Positions‌

  


The iSWAP is mounted on the pipetting arm of the ML STAR.

During pipetting, the iSWAP is in park position and does not affect the movement of the pipetting channels.

For plate transport steps, the pipetting tools will be moved away so that the greatest possible transport area will be available to the iSWAP. The orientation of the arm and gripper will be automatically calculated by the software according to the Deck Layout and programmed grip direction.

Using multi\-arm systems can affect the movement range.
3. ### ‌Grip and Opening Widths‌

  


“**Grip width**” and “**opening width before access**” can vary between 72 and 108 (132\) mm.

Archive and filter plates in particular have to be gripped no more than 28 mm below the upper rim. The lower rim of the plate should be no more than 35 mm below the gripping position, to prevent collision with other labware placed on the deck.
4. ### ‌Grip Force‌

  


The default grip force is appropriate for common MTPs. It should be set higher for archive plates, and lower for soft plates.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1644\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">

ATTENTION

In order to prevent spillage during transport with iSWAP, it is recommended not to overfill the wells (e.g. fill maximum 80 % of nominal well volume).

The maximum weight to be transported is 300 g. This should not be exceeded.

The rectangular racks should only be lifted from or placed onto carriers with slide guides (see the ML STAR Line Operator’s Manual).

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1645\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="379" height\="158">

The gripping area should be flat and stable. Ensure that the gripper's clamps will not pick up strips instead, the lower part of the plate's frame.

Define the correct plate orientation to ensure that plates lifted from MTP stacks via iSWAP can be identified on deck.

Affix plate barcodes correctly (see Technical  Specifications  in  the Microlab STAR Line Operator’s Manual).
5. ### ‌Pick\-up by iSWAP‌

  


Rectangular racks are always picked up at the short side. The gripper has a preferred gripping direction, which can be modified within the advanced settings of the “**GetPlate**” and “**iSwapTransport**” Steps.
6. ### ‌iSWAP Movement‌

  


In the case of a complex movement used to transport plates to or from stacks, shelves, etc., a plate once picked up will be moved up in small steps to the lift\-up height enabling collision\-free insertion or extraction.

Then it will be moved in horizontal direction by the retract distance out of a slot. Afterwards (as is the case for a single movement) the iSWAP will be moved in maximum z\-position (the greatest possible distance from the labware placed on the deck). The plate will be turned in such a way that the arm of the iSWAP is bent into a compact position for the x/y\-transport. The software controls these movements and prevents any collision with the pipetting channels or side panels.
7. ### ‌Plate Release‌

  


For plate release, the orientation of the arm and the gripper will be calculated automatically so that the orientation of position A1 of the plate is in accordance to the Deck Layout. If this is not possible, the plate must be gripped inversely (i.e. from the opposite side). See the VENUS Help Function.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1646\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

During plate placement, the plate will be gently pressed onto the rack. Ensure that strips are fixed securely in the frame.
8. ### ‌Accessible Areas‌

  


The iSWAP can be used over the whole deck area and the adjoining zones. The table below lists the coordinates of the accessible area relative to the zero point of the ML STAR:

NOTE

The minimal and maximal absolute positions of the x\- and y\-movement cannot be reached by the default settings of transport commands. Use the settings of “**Complex movement**” in the transport commands.

The standard configuration of an ML STAR Series instrument is WITH acrylic covers. The maximal and minimal absolute positions of the x\-movement can only be reached if the acrylic glass shields (left, right) are removed.

This is not only a mechanical issue. The instrument configuration has to be changed as well. Please contact a Hamilton Representative.

| Hand Rotation | \- 90° | \+ 90° | [See](#bookmark480) [Section 15\.1\.1 iSWAP Geometry](#bookmark480) |

Coordinates of Accessible Area

Certain plate orientations and gripping directions prevent the iSWAP from reaching the zones on both sides. For these cases, an easy method is recommended for plate transport.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1648\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">

ATTENTION

If a plate has to be gripped down low on the deck, enough space must also be left on the deck for the arm and gripper of iSWAP.
9. ### ‌Sequence Definitions for Transport Steps‌

  


[The iSWAP works on the basis of sequences (see](#bookmark486) [Section 15\.1\.7 iSWAP](#bookmark486) Movement). Plates are moved from one position to another, each defined by its own sequence. The labware definition remains fixed on the deck, but the plates change sequences. To make this possible, definition of target and source plate positions must be of the same labware type.

After processing of a sequence, the current position will be set to the next labware ID. If the same plate should be transported several times, select sequence counting '(0\) Manually' or set the current position back to the previous position.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1649\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

Sequence positions for transport steps are always differentiated by the labware ID. The current position of the transport sequence is to set the next labware ID in the sequence.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1650\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="206" height\="435"> <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1651\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="335" height\="180">

In the example above, after the transport of plate Source\_1, the current position will be set to plate Source\_2 (line 5\); and after transport of plate Soure\_2 to plate Source\_3 (line 9\).

It is recommended to define separate sequences for transport and pipetting, because the behavior of transport and pipetting is different.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1652\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

The orientation of the plate depends on plate positioning on the deck and not on sequences. The orientation can be changed under the “**Labware**” Tab by the function ”**Adjust Labware Position**” – “**Rotation**”).

2. ‌Programming the iSWAP‌
----

  


The following example demonstrates the use of iSWAP with Microlab STAR. A plate is transported from a stacker to a processing position. Here, its plate barcodes is also read. After pipetting some reagent, the plate is brought to a reader and read (simulated). Then, the plate is transported to an output stack.

Creating the Deck Layout

Use the “**Search Labware**” Field to add the following carriers to the deck: “**PLT\_CAR\_L4ST\_LOW\_A00\_4x9\_Nunc96**“

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1662\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="604" height\="283">

”**TIP\_CAR\_480\_ST\_A00**”

“**RGT\_CAR\_3R\_A01**”

                                                                          

“**PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00**“ with 1, “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_Lb**” on position 1\. Name it “**Processing**”. “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_Lb**”. Use the coordinates x \= \-70 / y \= 350 / z \= 160\) and name it “**Reader**”.

  


iSWAP Deck Layout

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1663\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

To save deck space, the stacker carrier can be positioned 4 tracks to the left of the deck (track positions –3 to \+3\), and the plates will still be fully accessible by the iSWAP.

Creating the Sequences


	1. Click the “**Sequences**” Tab and create the following sequences:
	2. On the foremost plate stack, select only the well A1 of all 9 plates. Make sure the stamp tool is set to “**Single position select**” and the sorting option is “**Top Down**” as shown below.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1664\).jpg" alt\="Seite\_390\_Graphik" data\-size\="original" width\="236" height\="204">
	3. This means that the stack from top to bottom is used as a SOURCE stack.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1665\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="309" height\="108">
	4. In the “**Advanced**” Window, check if the plate on top (the one with the highest z\-coordinate is on sequence position one. Save the sequence as ‘InputStack’.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1666\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="371" height\="104">
	5. Do the same for the output stack on position 4\. But this time, sort the sequence to start with the deepest position (sorting option is “**Descending**”).
	6. Save this sequence as “**OutputStack**”
	7. Rename the sequence “**rgt\_cont\_120ml\_a00\_0001**” to “**Reagent**”.Creating the Method

To create the required method:


	1. Drag and drop an “**iSwap Transport**” Step into the method. Since this is an Easy Step, an initialize step is not needed to initialize the instrument.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1667\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="297" height\="376">
	2. Set the ‘InputStack’ sequence as the get sequence. Activate the ‘Auto increment’ to make sure the current position points to the next plate after getting this one.
	3. Setting the ‘Search source labware first’ will force the iSWAP to check where the first free position is. This is especially helpful if the loading state of a stack is not known. The iSWAP will check this and set the current position according to the first free position.
	4. Activate the ‘Read plate barcode’ box to identify the plate. The Autoload will move to track 12 to read the plate’s barcode. If the default settings from this step are being used then there is no risk of collision. That means that the barcode reading with iSWAP is possible even on a fully loaded deck.
	5. Set the “**Parking the iSWAP after labware is placed**” to On.
	6. Use a “**Aliquote**” Smart Step to pipette 50μl of reagent over the full plate. Even if the sequence of the Reagent trough is used up, it will still restart at the beginning, since the Radio Button is set to **\[No, reuse the sequence from the beginning if necessary]**:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1668\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="389" height\="95">
	7. Also make sure the “**Initial sequence manipulation**” are set as follows:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1669\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="222">
	8. Because the sequence ‘Processing’ is used both for pipetting and transport, the “**Final sequence manipulation**” should be used as follows:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1670\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="222">
	9. Now, use an “**iSwapTransport**” Step to bring the plate from the “**Processing**” Position to the “**Reader**” Position. Do not park the iSWAP.
	10. Since there is no reader connected, a comment step is used to simulate this.
	11. After reading, the plate has to be taken at the reader position and brought to the output stack. Make sure the “**Auto increment**” is only set at the “**Output Stack**” Place Sequence.
	12. To have all plates processed, create a loop and move all steps inside. The loop limitation should be the sequence ‘InputStack’.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1671\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="581" height\="125">
	13. To make the method perfect, add an iSWAP park step at the end (the transport step in line 6 was set to park iSWAP \= Off).
	14. When all of the steps have been done, the method should look like this:  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1672\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="525" height\="353">
3. ‌Helpful Hints‌
------

  



	1. ### ‌Define Special Labware Data / Parameters Only Once‌
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1673\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
	
	NOTE
	
	It is possible to unmark the “**Generate default deck sequence**” in the “**Labware**” Tab. In this case, no default sequences are created.
	
	This option is helpful if many special sequences have to be created.
	
	  
	
	
	If the default values for GripForce, GripWidth, GripHeigth, OpeningWidthBeforeAccess (because an own new plate labware has been created or the method must use different values) are not used, it would seem sensible to save these parameters in a variable. This can be done by selecting “**View**”  “**Variables**” in the Method Editor.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1674\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="279" height\="185">
	
	
		1. To create a new variable, enter the Context Menu with a right mouse click and select “**New**”. The dialog box below will then appear and can be filled out.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1675\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="248" height\="320">
		2. It is now possible to create many variables as needed.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1676\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="297" height\="172">
		3. These variables can now be used in all iSWAP or CO\-RE gripper commands for the special plate.
		4. If there are multiple grip commands for this plate in the method, it is much faster to change these values once in the variable definition. Of course, every plate type needs its own parameters.
	2. ### ‌Move to Positions Outside of the Slot Area‌
	
	  
	
	
	The iSWAP is able to reach positions outside the slot area or below the deck’s surface (check the specifications for the exact range).
	
	Use the “**AdjustPosition**” Function (double click on the labware) to move a plate outside the slot area. Find the position using the **\[Move Probe]**.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1677\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="436" height\="227">
	
	  
	
	
	If a collision is possible (e.g. with the housing of a reader), select “**Complex Movement**” as the “**Movement Type**” and define a “**Retract Distance**” greater than the plate length. Refer to the image below.
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1678\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="334" height\="372">
	
	  
	
	
	All bending and turning moves are now executed in a way which is directed away from the housing. The iSWAP will drive to the position using x\-drive.

2. ‌CO\-RE Gripper‌‌
=================

This section provides information about labware handling using the CO\-RE gripper.

The CO\-RE gripper transports the following to and from positions on the deck of the ML STAR:


	* Microplates
	* Covers of microplates
	* Archive plates
	* Filter plates
	* Manifold top of the BVS / CVS systemPlates can be gripped in landscape or portrait format within the working area. Rotation of plates is not an option and no process control \- checking whether plates are gripped or not \- is integrated in the software. An additional “**Plate Turning Station**” can be used to rotate a plate.

The CO\-RE gripper consists of two gripping “**jaws**” that are held by two neighboring pipetting channels of the ML STAR. The pipetting channels can be freely selected. The “**Traverse height**” of the pipetting channels with the gripping jaws is the same as with the tips: 145mm above the deck.

Given that there is no torque sensor at work here, ensure that the CO\-RE gripper does not grip plates too tightly. The distance between the jaws that is specified for gripping should be smaller than the length or width of the plate.

	2. ‌Programming the CO\-RE Gripper / Use of Arrays‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	The following example demonstrates the use of the CO\-RE gripper robotic plate handler with ML STAR. A set of plates are taken from the input carrier and brought to the barcode reading position of a third party barcode reader. Then, the plate is placed on another carrier for further actions (that are not part of this example).
	
	Reading of the plate’s barcode is done by a third party barcode reader. In the example, a comment to simulate this is used. In real life, this could be a Metrologic Orbit reader that is controlled through the HSLBarcodereader library. Please activate this library to read the barcode when working on a real system.
	
	The positions where to get the plates and where to put it after reading are not specified directly, but in an array. An array can be imaged as a table with two columns. In column one, the index is stored. This value is not changeable by the user. It always starts at one. The second column of the array can be filled by the user. Either a variable of type integer, float, and string can be stored or a sequence name can be stored in this cell.

	Array of VARIABLES Array of SEQUENCES
	
	  
	
	
	Far ahead in the method, these arrays can be read out and the values from e.g. the second column can be used as pipetting volumes, number of loops etc. (in case of an array of variables) or these values specify where to aspirate, where to get a plate etc. (in case of an array of sequences).

	Target and source plate positions must be of the same labware type.
	
	  
	
	
	Creating the Deck Layout
	
	To work through this example, create the Deck Layout by following these steps:
	
	
		1. Click the “**Labware**“ Tab in the Method Editor.
		2. Add two plate carriers “**PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00**” from the ML STAR carriers under the Plate carrier folder onto the deck.
		3. Add three plates on each carrier. The plate type could be “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_Lb (low border)**”. Name these plates ‘Input1’ to ‘Input3’ on one carrier and ‘Output1’ to ‘Output3’ on the other carrier.
		4. Add a plate “**Nun\_96\_Fl\_Lb (low border)**” directly on the deck. The coordinates should be x \= 1100 / y \= 150 / z \= 150\. This will be our position to read the plate’s barcode. Name it "**ReadPosition**". External in this case means that is not built in the ML STAR, but of course it must be located on the track area so the CO\-RE gripper is able to reach the position.
		5. Add the COREGripTool\_AtWaste\_1000μl to the waste (it will snap).

	Creating the Sequences
	
	In this example, only the default generated sequences were used.
	
	  
	
	
	Creating the Method
	
	The resulting method should look like shown below:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1694\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="484" height\="398">
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. The method will start with an initialization step. This step is always needed if a method does not start with a Smart Step or an Easy Step.
		2. Steps 3 and 4 are used to create two empty arrays, one for the source\- and one for the target sequences. The array: Declare / Set Size step shows that an array of sequences is generated and shall be empty.
		3. Empty array means that the number of entries the array will have is unknown. However, if the number of entries is already known, specify the array with the corresponding size. To do this, use the **\[New size]** field.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1695\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="387" height\="174">
		4. The next sets of steps (6\-8 and 10\-12\) are used for filling both the array of GetPlatePositions and the array of PlacePlatePositions. Using the option “**Add to the end of the array**” will store the sequences in order of adding:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1696\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="473" height\="129">
		5. Steps 6 to 8 and 11 to 12 are writing sequences into the newly declared arrays of sequences.
		6. Step 13 is used to find out how many entries are stored in an array. It will store the number of array entries into the variable NumOfEntries. This is especially used if the number of entries is unknown (e.g. if reading values or sequences from a file).
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1697\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="355" height\="116">
		7. The number of entries can be used as the number of loop runs:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1698\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="611" height\="109">
		8. The GetPlate step in line 15 does **not** have a sequence included. The sequence is read out of the array ‘GetPlatePositions’ and the position where to read is given by the LoopCounter1 variable.
		9. Click the <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1699\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="17" height\="19"> sign to set the array index seen below.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1700\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="364" height\="366">
		10. In the first loop round, the GetPlate step is using the sequence stored in the array under position 1 (specified by the loopCounter1\).
		11. The MovePlate in step 16 will move the plate to the barcode reader position. In the trace file, the barcode of the plate can be seen.
		12. Step 17 will place the plate on a specific position. This position is defined by a sequence and stored in the second array. All of these must be done similar to the GetPlate step in line 16: simply define the array and the index then the sequence will be read out of the array.

	3. ‌CO\-RE Gripper Transport: Avoiding Z\-Step Loss‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Keep in mind that the CO\-RE gripper for the 5ml\-pipetting channel needs more space than the 1000μl\-pipetting channel CO\-RE gripper tools. This can lead to Z\-Step Loss when a Deck Layout is not properly set up (see below).

	4. ‌CO\-RE Gripper Transport: Avoiding Y\-Step Loss‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	The 5ml\-pipetting channels are less flexible than the 1000μl\-pipetting channels due to their massive construction. Therefore, it makes sense to try low grip forces for labware transports.
	
	In the event of heavy labware (e.g. filled Deep Well Plates), switching to higher grip forces can be done.
	5. ‌CO\-RE Gripper Transport: Adding the Suitable Tool‌
	-----
	
	  
	
	
	The Deck Layout Editor shows several tools for the CO\-RE Gripper. The next statement is the correct use of the labware.
	
	COREGripTool OnWaste 1000μl uses a holder for the paddles mounted on top of the waste block. This is a holder that is capable to hold both 1000μl\-pipetting channel and 5ml\-pipetting channel paddles.
	
	Using this labware will create the default sequence for 1000μl\-pipetting channel paddles.

		1. ### ‌Use Various Channels for CO\-RE Gripper Transports‌
		
		  
		
		
		By default, pipetting channels 7 and 8 are used to execute CO\-RE gripper transports. Having a method with many transport steps, these two pipetting channels are stressed more than the others. The input field “**Used Front Channel**” was designed to use different pipetting channels for the transports, which shares the applied load to all pipetting channels of an instrument.
		
		The following program lines make sure that first, pipetting channels 1\+2 are used. In the next “**Get Plate**” Command, pipetting channels 3\+4 will be used (and so on). In this manner, the pickup commands are spread over all the pipetting channels and the mechanical system of all pipetting channels are strained to the same degree.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1713\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="374" height\="374">
		
		  
		
		
		
			1. Create a sub\-method called “**CalculateFrontChannel**”
			2. Make an assignment with calculation: “**FrontChannel \= FrontChannel \+ 2**”
			3. Make an if statement: “If FrontChannel is greater than 8\*  FrontChannel \= 2”
			4. Having a different number of pipetting channels on the instrument, enter e.g. 4, 12, 16
			5. Now, make sure that the “**FrontChannel**” Variable is global and valid in all sub\-methods:
			6. Click on “**Method**  **Export Local Variables”** and select *FrontChannel*, then click **\[OK]**.
			7. The sub\-method should look like this:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1714\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="375" height\="170">
			8. All that remains to be done is to set a start value in the main method:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1715\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="429" height\="109">
			9. Insert the CalculateFrontChannel sub method in the method right before the GetPlate, as seen below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1716\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="496" height\="193">
			10. In the CO\-RE gripper “**Get Plate**” Command, set the “**FrontChannel**” Variable.  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1717\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="217" height\="148">
		2. ### ‌Read Plate Barcode using the CO\-RE Gripper (only available with Autoload)‌
		
		  
		
		
		If the command “**CO\-RE gripper Read Barcode**” is used, like this:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1718\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="246" height\="170">
		
		  
		
		
		Six tracks on the left side of the barcode reading position (inclusive) have to be empty, otherwise the plate will crash into the carriers on these positions. For example, if the track number of the barcode reader (Autoload) is set to 8, track numbers 3\-8 have to be empty. The following sketch shows the situation:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1719\).gif" alt\="13\-12\-2012 10\-40\-15" data\-size\="original" width\="584" height\="274">
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1720\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		It is recommended to use the pipetting channels closest to the front for transporting plates to the barcode reader.
3. ‌Tube Handling Tools‌



	1. ‌Tube\-gripper‌

	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1721\).jpg" alt\="tubeGripper" data\-size\="original" width\="82" height\="178">
	
	This section provides all necessary information about the tube\-gripper. This tool can be used to move tubes to a barcode reader (if the Autoload option is not installed), to load/unload tubes to an integrated centrifuge, to pick specific tubes from multiple carriers into one target carrier, to move tubes to a balance (measuring evaporation), etc.
	
	This tool is mounted on a pipetting channel and can be moved over the deck in the same way as the pipetting channels.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Using the Tube\-gripper Steps‌
		
		  
		
		
		First, make sure that the tube\-gripper is activated in the Hamilton System Configuration Editor. Set both the tube\-gripper and the Autoload option line to ‘Available’ as shown below:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1722\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="353" height\="369">
		
		In the Method Editor, the tube\-gripper steps are found:
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1723\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="200" height\="73">
		
		“**Tube Grip Get”**
		
		This step is used to pick a tube. The parameters to pass are the following:
		
		
			* Sequence (where to get the tube)
			* Sequence counting (manually, to leave the current position untouched)
			* Grip height in mm, measured from the top of the tube
			* Opening width before access in mm (maximum \= 24mm)
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1724\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="265" height\="320">
			
			  
			
			
			“Tube Grip Place”
			
			This step is used to place a gripped tube. The parameters to pass are the following:
			* Sequence (where to put the tube)
			* Sequence counting (manually, to leave the current position untouched)
			* Relative clamp open width in mm.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1725\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="275" height\="297">
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1726\).gif" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			The relative clamp open width is a relative value. If the gripped tube requires a clamp position of 20mm, there is only 4mm left to open (because 24mm is the maximum opening width).
			
			  
			
			
			“Tube Grip Move”
			
			This step is used to move a gripped tube to a specific position without opening the clamp. This could be used e.g. to move the tube in front of an external barcode reader.
			
			The parameter to pass is the:
			* Sequence (where to move \[and hold] the tube).
			
			Keep in mind that the step will move the tube to the current position of the sequence that has been passed.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1727\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="275" height\="185">
			
			  
			
			
			“Tube Grip Read Barcode”
			
			This step is used to move a gripped tube to a specific position without opening the clamp. This step will grip a tube and bring it to the Autoload barcode reader for reading.
			
			The parameter to pass is the:
			* Reader position \[track number]This value specifies the track, where the Autoload barcode reader will move to. After the movement to this position, the tube\-gripper will bring the tube in front of the reader and read the barcode.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1728\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="264" height\="186">
		
		In order to link the value of the barcode to a variable, the return value of the step has to be linked.
		
		
			1. To do so, right\-click the Tube Grip Read Barcode in the method and select ‘Bind Return values’:
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1729\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="503" height\="299">
			2. A window opens to link the different return values to variables. The value from line 4 (which is the barcode) will be used in the example as seen in the image below.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1730\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="466" height\="270">
			3. Type in or select a variable that will hold the value of the barcode. Finish with **\[OK]**.<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1731\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
		
		NOTE
		
		The tube\-gripper is able to grip tubes with an outer diameter of 8 to 22mm.
		
		The tube\-gripper clamps need additional space when gripping tubes with large diameter (15 – 22mm). In an event like this, leave a space on the left and right of the tube carrier.

4. ‌Hamilton Heater Shaker‌
===

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1733\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="221" height\="189">

The Hamilton Heater Shaker (HHS) is designed to heat and/or shake standard Microplates in SBS format.

[To operate the HHS, a specific library is required. The maximum shaking speed depends on the labware used. For details, see](#bookmark338) [Section](#bookmark338) 11\.12\.23[HHS](#bookmark338) Library. Shaking can be performed clockwise or counter\-clockwise.

Before the heating or shaking is started, the plates are locked and positioned in the center of the HHS. When heating or shaking has been finished, the plates are unlocked and can then easily be removed from the HHS.

The HHS can be heated to temperatures up to 105°C. The temperature is constantly measured by two sensors, one located in the middle and one at the edge of the adapter plate.

  



	1. ‌Programming the Hamilton Heater Shaker‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	The following two examples demonstrate the use of the HHS.
	
	Before using the HHS, a connection and device number has to be generated. After the connection has been established, the heater shaker will be initialized.
	
	The library offers two commands for this task, depending on the kind of connection determined by the hardware. For connections made via TCC, use the “**CreateStarDevice**” Command (used for connecting 1 or 2 heater shakers); otherwise use the “**CreateUSBDevice**” Command. In both cases, a device number is generated that can be stored in a variable. This variable must be used in all other commands of the library to control the heater shaker.
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| Library Function | | |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| Number of HHS | Icon | Action Performed |
	| 1 – 2 | <img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1734\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="50" height\="44"> | Create Star Device(Establish a connection to 1 or 2 shakers connected via TCC) |

	NOTE
	
	It is required to establish a connection to all heater shakers that will be used in the method. If, for example, only two out of four shakers have been initialized, only these two shakers can be started using the “**StartAllShaker**” Function.

		1. ### ‌Example 1: Controlling One Hamilton Heater Shaker‌
		
		  
		
		
		In this example, a single heater shaker is connected via the ML STAR instrument TCC connector. The heater shaker is heated to 65°C followed by 10 mins shaking at 200 rpm. A detailed description of all the steps can be found in the following section.

		Overview of a method to run the heater shaker at 200 rpm for 10 minutes at 65°C
		
		
			1. ‌Step by Step Analysis of Example 1
			
			  
			
			
			Step 1: Create a connection to the shaker through the “CreateStarDevice” Command. The node can be “1” or “2” if the heater shaker is connected via TCC. The device number can be assigned, which is generated by this command, to any variable of choice. This variable has to be used for all subsequent commands regarding the control of the heater shaker.

			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1741\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">
			
			NOTE
			
			When inserting a step in the method for the first time, on the toolbar, the “**New**” Add\-on is imprinted.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1742\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML12dd760" data\-size\="original" width\="416" height\="31">
			
			If there has been already a method inserted, when editing, the add\-on “**Edit**” is imprinted.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1743\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML12e2d6c" data\-size\="original" width\="416" height\="31">
			
			Step 2: Use the variable containing the device number to access the correct heater shaker. Set the temperature to 65°C. If the “waitForTempReached” Option is chosen with the setting “1”, the method will pause at this step until the defined temperature has been reached and is stable for 180 seconds. Only then the method will continue to the next step. If a pause to the method is not wanted but rather carry out other tasks in parallel to the heating process, the “waitForTempReached” should be set to “0”. At a later time, the temperature can be checked and if necessary, wait for the heating process to finish using the “WaitForTempCtrl” Command.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1744\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML4846c1" data\-size\="original" width\="451" height\="283">
			
			  
			
			
			**Step 3:** Here, the shaking parameters, shaking speed and duration of shaking can be set. The speed is defined in rpm and the time in seconds. The shaking speed ranges from 30 rpm to 2500 rpm. The maximum speed depends on the orbit and adapter of the shaker and must not exceed the maximum given in the “**Technical Specifications**” (Please refer to the Technical Specifications in the ML STAR Line Operator´s Manual). Any function to start shaking will also close the plate lock automatically.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1745\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML11c328a" data\-size\="original" width\="455" height\="283">
			
			Step 4: This command will wait until the shaker defined by the device number has finished the timed shaking process. If the shaker is already finished before this function is called, the method will immediately proceed with the next step. This function will also open the plate lock.

			Step 5: As heating is controlled independently from shaking, the heating process has to be terminated explicitly. Otherwise, the heater shaker will continue heating even if it is not used anymore.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1747\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML11e194f" data\-size\="original" width\="507" height\="315">
			
			Step 6: If the heater shaker will not be used any longer, the connection can be terminated. At the end of a method or upon abort, the connection is automatically terminated and will stop heating as well as shaking. The plate lock will then open.

			The figure above shows a schematic view of the heating and shaking process of Example 1\.
		2. ### ‌Safety Measures Upon Method Abort‌
		
		  
		
		
		As soon as the method is aborted, the heater shaker will automatically be stopped. This implies that the heating and shaking process is stopped. The plate lock is opened and the connection to the heater shaker is terminated. No further precautions within the submethod **“OnAbort”** are required.
		3. ### ‌Example 2: Controlling Multiple Hamilton Heater Shakers‌
		
		  
		
		
		This example shows the usage of multiple heater shakers via USB and the heater shaker box. The connection via USB and HSB is needed in order to control more than two heater shakers. The method is using three heater shakers with different temperature settings.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1750\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="525" height\="405">
		
		
			1. ‌Step by Step Analysis of Example 2
			
			  
			
			
			Step 1\-3: Create a connection to all heater shakers to be used in this method using the function “CreateUSBDevice”. It is required to initialize each shaker individually in order to create a device number and to control the heater shaker throughout the method. Heater shakers that are not initialized cannot be started with the “StartAllShaker” Function.
			
			The usedNode can range from 1 to 8, depending on the number of heater shakers in use. Node 1 corresponds to the master heater shaker.
			
			The deviceNumber is stored in a variable, which is needed to control the heater shaker in all subsequent functions.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1751\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML1200dea" data\-size\="original" width\="468" height\="292">
			
			  
			
			
			Step 4\-6: Set the temperatures for each individual heater shaker, for example to 50°, 60° and 70°C as shown below. If working with several heater shakers, the option “waitForTempReached” has to be set to “0” so that all shakers are heated in parallel.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1752\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML12108db" data\-size\="original" width\="507" height\="315">
			
			Step 7\-9: Wait until all heater shakers have reached the set temperature before proceeding to the next step.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1753\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML1220cd1" data\-size\="original" width\="498" height\="310">
			
			  
			
			
			Step 10\-12: The “SetShakerParameter” function can be used to change the shaking direction or acceleration of the heater shaker. Usually, the default settings can be used. The default settings are clockwise shaking and an acceleration of 1250\. The shaking direction can be changed by entering “1” for counter\-clockwise shaking. The value for the acceleration (shakingAccRamp) ranges from 630 to 125000\. The default setting of 1250 matches up the acceleration from 0 to the maximum speed of 2500 rpm within two seconds.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1754\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML1230fce" data\-size\="original" width\="448" height\="279">
			
			Step 13: All shakers can be started in parallel. Here, the shaking speed is set to 2000 rpm. This function will automatically close the plate lock on all shakers.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1755\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML123f51d" data\-size\="original" width\="448" height\="279">
			
			  
			
			
			Step 16: To finish shaking of all shakers at the same time use the “StopAllShaker” Function. This function does not require any device numbers but will stop all initialized shakers and will automatically open the plate lock.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1756\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML124934f" data\-size\="original" width\="448" height\="279">
			
			Step 17\-19: The temperature control of the heater shaker can be terminated after its usage. If the temperature control is not stopped, heating will continue even after terminating the shaking process.
			
			  
			
			
			<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1757\).png" alt\="SNAGHTML12535c5" data\-size\="original" width\="455" height\="283">
			
			  
			
			
			Step 20: The connections to the heater shakers are terminated. This step can be omitted at the end of a method, since the connections to all heater shakers are anyway automatically terminated at the end of a method or upon abort of a method.

		4. ### ‌Monitoring the Performance of the Hamilton Heater Shaker‌
		
		  
		
		
		For some applications, it might be desirable to monitor the performance of the heater shaker. The library offers the possibility to monitor the shaking speed and temperature during an application. The status of the heater shaker is continuously written to the trace file. The settings for the monitoring can be adjusted within the functions “**BeginMonitoring**” and “**SetTempParameter**”.
		
		Within the function “**BeginMonitoring**” the intervals can be defined, like how often the performance of the heater shaker will be checked and the deviation from the set shaking speed that will be tolerated. Choosing which action will be taken if monitoring reports an out of range measurement is also possible.
		
		All settings regarding the temperature control have to be made within the function “**SetTempParameter**”, although the default settings are usually already sufficient.
		
		After monitoring, the return value from the function “**EndMonitoring**” can be examined. The function reports whether heating or shaking or both were out of range.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1759\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="65" height\="57">
		
		ATTENTION
		
		Placing a cold plate on the hot heater shaker will cool down the heater shaker so that the temperature might fall below the defined tolerated temperature range. In this case, the “**BeginMonitoring**” Function will return an error even if heating is working correctly.
		
		To avoid this kind of error, the “**StartTempCtrl**” Function has to be used immediately before the transport step. This results in heating the heater shaker again until the temperature is stable for 3 min. Monitoring is paused during the “**StartTempCtrl**” Step.
		
		  
		
		
		The image below is an example of the monitoring function.

			2
			
			1
			
			3
			2. Add the template for the DC needle wash station: ***Car\_DC\_WashStation\_CR\_Needle\_A01*** to the layout.
			
			The following sequences belong to the template of the DC needle wash station:
			
			  
			
			
			
			
			| Pos | Sequence Name | Use |
			| --- | --- | --- |
			| 1 | waste\_dc\_washstation\_0001 | Dispensing the rest volume before the needle wash (empty tip). |
			| 2 | waste\_dc\_washstation\_0002 | Dispensing the rest volume before the needle wash (empty tip). |
			| 3 | washchamber\_dc\_washstation\_0001 | Washing the needles. |
			3. Add the needle sequence (according to the used needles and the Node ID setting of the pump unit and washer unit) to the template of the DC needle wash station. The needle sequence corresponds to the position (for picking up/ releasing) of the needles.
			
			E.g. ***DC 300μl needles rack (HU)***

7. ‌Wash Station 96‌
=================

The Wash station 96 is an optional device for washing 96 disposable tips in parallel. The tips are washed both outside and inside at the same time: on the outside in the wash chamber of the wash station 96 and on the inside by aspiration/dispense cycles with the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head. The result of washing the tips depends on the wash setting.

8. ‌Wash Station 96/384‌


The Wash Station 96/384 is an optional device for washing 96/384 disposable tips in parallel. The tips are washed both outside and inside at the same time: on the outside in the wash chambers of the wash station and on the inside by aspiration/dispense cycles using the CO\-RE 96 Probe Head / TADM or the CO\-RE 384 Probe Head. The result of washing the tips depends on the wash setting.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1803\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

If carry\-over is not acceptable for the application, use new disposable tips for each aspiration step.

  


Sample transfers can be done using new disposable tips, while reagents, buffers, etc. can be distributed with washed tips.

The picture below shows a complete, hooked\-up wash station 96/384:

NOTE

Always empty the waste container when refilling the wash solution container. When re\-using washed tips, pipetting precision may increase by a factor of 3\.


	1. ‌Command Description‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	The table below gives a brief overview of the available commands for the wash station 96/384\. Another possibility to wash the tips is given by the basic step commands “**CO\-RE 96 Head Dispense**” / “**CO\-RE 384 Head Dispense**”. In the basic dispense step, the wash function can be enabled via the “**Wash tips after dispense**” Parameter. The wash parameter can be set through the **\[Customize…]** Button.

	ATTENTION
	
	The CO\-RE 384 Probe Head performs a blow out after the wash steps. The software automatically uses the tip picking up position (tip rack). Therefore do not reload the tip rack of the pick\-up position if performing any wash steps.
	2. ‌Programming the Wash Station 96/384‌
	
	
	  
	
	
	The following is a simple example on how to program the wash station 96/384 using the Single Steps.

9. ‌Temperature Controlled Carrier (TCC)‌
=================

The temperature controlled carrier (TCC) is a device for heating and cooling of microplates. It has four positions for microplates which are all of the same temperature. The TCC can heat microplates up to 60°C or cool them down to 22°C below ambient temperature.

A maximum of two TCCs can be placed on one ML STAR and controlled by the VENUS Software. Activate the Temperature Controlled Carrier in the System Configuration Editor (ML STAR Tab).

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1818\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="339" height\="234">

  


The method is also using the sample tracker to store the pipetting data to a file. It can be activated in the System Configuration Editor (System Tab) as well.

	2. ‌Programming the TCC / Sample Tracking‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	The following example makes use of the TCC and shows the additional functionality of the ML STAR user software. It can be found under the name “**Example**”.
	
	  
	
	
	Creating the Deck Layout
	
	Create the Deck Layout holding the following:
	
	
		* Tip carrier (TIP\_CAR\_480\_ST\_A00\).
		* 6 tube carriers (SMP\_CAR\_32\_12x75\_A00\) for 32 sample tubes each.
		* Temperature\-controlled carrier (Car\_TCC\_1\).
		* Two standard Nunc plates (Nun\_96\_Fl\_L) on the TCC.

	3. ‌Creating the Sequences‌
	-----
	
	  
	
	
	Under the “**Sequences**” Tab, select the “**Channels**” Stamp Tool and create the following:
	
	
		* A sequence over all six tube carriers named “**AllSamples**”.
		* A sequence over the two plates named ‘Target’.Creating the Method
	
	In order to use the “Generate Mapping File” Step, which will create an output file with source / target / volume information, the “Data Handling Steps” Option has to be activated in “Method  Instruments and Smart Steps”
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1823\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="590" height\="119">

	Method Analysis
	
	A look on how the method is constructed.
	
	
		1. First, all carriers are loaded using the “**Load**” Smart Step:
		2. A user input is used in line 2 to get both the number of samples to process and the temperature of the TCC to set. Do not forget to enclose the text in quotation marks; otherwise the system will interpret it as a new variable.
		3. Step 3 will set the temperature of the TCC.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1825\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="230" height\="302">
		4. The carrier temperature is not set in absolute. It is held in the variable depending on the user’s input.
		5. Please note that this step will continue when the temperature is reached. This means that it will wait for 600 sec and then check if the temperature was reached. For detailed information, refer to the steps in the help file.
		6. In step 4, the end position of the AllSamples sequence is set to the number the user has specified. Since there is a limit in the user’s input, the number cannot be set wrong.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1826\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="468" height\="130">
		7. The “**Pipette Simple**” Step will bring the liquid from the tubes into the plate. Depending on the number of samples, either only one plate or both plates are used.
		8. In step 6 a “**Report Mapping File**[” is generated. In this file, all the liquid transfers of selectable sequences are reported. Refer to](#bookmark302) [Section  11\.9\.2  Generating  a  Mapping](#bookmark302) File for more information.
		9. Enter a sequence in the “**Generate mapping file(s) of sequence**” Field. The mapping file will contain all information about the liquid that was pipetted into the sequence. Using “**Sequences of interest**”, it is possible to select which source sequences shall be taken into account.
		10. In the “**Sequences of interest**”, selecting sequences where the liquid comes from is specified. In this case, the samples are coming from the AllSample sequences. If there was a buffer or reagent sequence as well, insert those sequences too. This is to see where all liquid comes from.
		11. The filename is created by a constant string, but it is more useful to use information contained in the database by place\-holders. The default file name is built using the labware ID, the barcode and an auto\-incrementing number.
		12. The path where to store the mapping file(s) has to be specified. If left blank like in the example, the data will be stored to the logfiles directory.
		13. If a customized path is entered, be sure the path exists before the mapping file has to be generated.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1827\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="434" height\="368">
		14. The output file will be filtered to contain only the error free processed samples.
		15. To do so, click the **\[Customize…]** Button.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1828\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="437" height\="103">
		16. To filter and keep the errorless ones only, select the **\[Without errors only]** Radio Button.
		17. In the Sorting field, specify the sorting direction to “**Sort records by column**”.
		18. As seen below, it is possible to customize the columns. The standard and constant columns are displayed on the left side; either the CAT heater shaker or TELESHAKE. Renaming the column name on the right side can be done.
		
		  
		
		
		<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1829\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="435" height\="320">
		19. The resulting file is shown below. If customized column names are specified, all columns are marked with a “**T**” refers to the Target Sequence while all columns beginning with “**S**” refers to the Source Sequence.

10. ‌Basic Vacuum System (BVS) / Crystal Vacuum System (CVS)‌
===============

The CVS (Crystal Vacuum System) consists of a seven\-track\-wide carrier with a vacuum manifold, a park position for the manifold top and two plate positions. The rear Microplate position can be replaced by a Hamilton Heater Shaker.

The vacuum is generated with a pump, for example from Vacuubrand, which can be controlled by the VENUS Software.

The manifold top can be handled either by the iSWAP or the CO\-RE Gripper. If the iSWAP are used for these movements, four tracks next to the BVS / CVS carrier have to be empty, usually on the right side.

For more details about the CVS, refer to the ML STAR Line Operator’s Manual.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1831\).jpg" alt\="Originalbild anzeigen" data\-size\="original" width\="64" height\="64">

NOTE

BVS and CVS are similar and need the same programming steps but different labware. If it is not certain which labware is at hand, teach the position inside the active position to avoid step losses during plate transports.

  



	1. ‌Command Description‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	The commands for the BVS / CVS are functions of the additional library “HSLVacuuBrandPump.hsl”. To make the library functions available, install the library through “Tools  Hamilton Support Software...“.
	
	The following commands are integrated in the “**HSLVacuuBrandPump**” Library:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1832\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="269" height\="315">
	
	The commands control only the VacuuBrand vacuum pump of the BVS / CVS \- the vacuum pump itself and the air admittance valve. The controlling of the vacuum system runs in the background, independently from the method. This means that there is no need to create a parallel task. The only thing to do is to set the transport steps to and from the BVS / CVS and the transport of the manifold.
	
	There are two libraries combined under one library tab: The old HSLVacuuBrandPump library (Low Level Steps) and the new HSLStarBVSLib (High Level Steps).

	[The labware for the CVS carrier can be downloaded from the](http://www.hamiltoncompany.com/support/laboratory-automation/resource-center) Resource Center. The labware for the BVS / CVS carrier is saved in the folder “ML STAR CVS”. Three definitions are predefined for BVS / CVS carriers:
	
	
		* with no shaker
		* with one shaker on position 1
		* with one shaker on position 2No labware is preloaded on the vacuum system carriers.

	NOTE
	
	Three different versions of vacuum systems exist. All versions need the same programming steps, but different labware. If it is not certain which labware is at hand, teach the position inside the active position to avoid step losses during plate transports.
	
	The z\-position within the active position of the vacuum system is shown with different levels. See image below.

	Method Analysis
	
	Step 1: Initialization of the instrument and the VacuuBrand pump.
	
	Step 2: Pipette samples from tubes into the filter plate on the manifold.
	
	Make sure that the dispensing details settings in step 5 of the Smart Step are set as shown below.
	
	The final sequence manipulation is now used to reset the filter plate sequence back to the start point (current \= 1\).

	PumpID: The id of the vacuum pump. Having more than one pump, count up from 1\. DeltaPressure: The negative pressure in millibar, calculated from ambient pressure. Duration: The time of the vacuum action in seconds.
	
	OpenValve: 1 opens the valve after the duration, 0 leaves the valve closed so that the pressure is kept in the vacuum chamber.
	
	ThreshPressure: This is the limit at which the system will indicate the vacuum action as OK (e.g. ambient pressure was read 900 mbar, delta pressure is set to 300 (that means down to 600 mbar) and the threshPressure is set to 200 (that means 700 mbar). If the system is able to reach the threshPressure, the action will be stated as OK.
	
	ReachedPressure: Here, a variable that holds the value of the deepest pressure reached during this run (to write in the trace file or for your own decisions within the method) can be inserted.
	
	For the steps that follow, refer to the method presented in the preceding two pages
	
	Step 6: moves the manifold with the filter plate to the PARK position of the BVS using CO\-RE Grip.
	
	Step 7: moves the target plate from the plate carrier into the lower position of BVS, with the CO\- RE Grip.
	
	Step 8: moves the manifold with the filter plate back to the ACTIVE position of the BVS.
	
	Step 9: aliquots the solving reagent from the ReagentCarrier onto the filter plate. This is used to solve the samples from the filter so they can be transferred to the target plate underneath the filter plate. Copy step 4 and change the aspirate position.
	
	Step 10: Vacuum action to bring the samples from the filter plate in the TargetPlate. Copy step 5 and change the duration to 300 seconds.
	
	Steps 11 and 12 move the manifold to the park position (copy step 6\) and bring the target plate back to the plate carrier.
	
	Step 13: will finally terminate the connection between the vacuum pump and PC.

	3. ‌Activating BVS / CVS Maintenance‌
	------
	
	  
	
	
	Activation of BVS / CVS maintenance requires the source files “**HslStarLineMaintMetConst.hs\_**” and “**HslStarLineMaintMetConst.stp**”. These files can be found in the **…\\HAMILTON\\Library** Folder.
	
	The files can be modified individually by following the instructions below:
	
	
		1. Make a copy of the “**HslStarLineMaintMetConst.hs\_**” HSL file.
		2. Modify the value of the constant “**isBVSInstalled(hslFalse);**” to “**isBVSInstalled(hslTrue);**”.
		3. Save the file.
		4. After checking the syntax, the same file with an extension of “**.stp**” will be attained.
		5. Rename the original files to something similar to “**old\_ HslStarLineMaintMetConst.hs\_**” and “**old\_ HslStarLineMaintMetConst.stp**”.
		6. Finally rename the files that have been generated to the original names.
11. ‌The HSL Method Editor‌
==

HSL or Hamilton Standard Language is the underlying programming language that the VENUS Software is operated from. HSL is a C/C\+\+ style programming language. To use HSL, the HSL Method Editor must be started. It is a separate program that is located in “**C:\\Program Files\\Hamilton\\Bin\\HxHslMetEd.exe**” (depending on the language/installation settings).

The editor is an acclaimed and outstanding text editor. An hsl file can be written using a text editor however the checksum lines have to be checked personally.

  


<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1861\).gif" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="581" height\="396">

  


Before an HSL file is run, it has to be compiled (translated) into a basic computer language. This is done by the “**MICROLAB STAR Run**” Program, which should already be familiar.

<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1862\).png" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="272" height\="180">

  


behind is....

Unlike a C/C\+\+ program, the file is compiled just before it is run. This is done every time it is run. The Hamilton Method Editor is actually a code generator that creates an HSL code simultaneously**.** The Run Engine (compiler) runs the HSL file, not the ‘.med’ file.

	1. ‌HSL File Types‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	HSL is usually used to create libraries. There are actually 2 HSL file types that may be encountered:
	
	Files with a file extension of “**.hsl**” are known as header files while files with an extension of “**.hs\_**” are known as Source Files or Implementation Files.
	
	Typically header files will contain only declarations of functions and variables while source files contain the actual code that is in the function (known as the function implementation).
	
	There are three main reasons to split into header and source files:
	
	
		1. It allows another person to look only at the header file and know what the functions do. It is not necessary to analyze they work.
		2. Sometimes there is a need to create additional functions, for the functions in the header to work but, may not want others to see them. Anything declared in the implementation file is not visible when the declaration file is included.
		3. It enhances the speed of the VENUS Method Editor.
	2. ‌HSL Syntax‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	Most lines of code must end with a semicolon (;). Generally a new line is started after a semicolon. But this does not need to be done (just makes the code easier to read).
	
	The space between lines is known as whitespace and has no function.
	
	Use of a double forward slash (//) indicates that the following characters in this line are comments only. A forward slash followed by a star (/\*) together with the star followed by a forward slash (\*/) indicates a comment block which can be separated over multiple lines. This will be interpreted as comment text and is not executed at runtime.
	3. ‌Code Block‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	A code block contains the actual coding in the HSL files. The following can be seen here:
	
	
		* Variable declaration and calculation
		* Conditional processing (loops and if, else statements)
		* Function calls
		* A Variety of other thingsCode blocks always begin and end with curly brackets { … }.
	4. ‌Keywords‌
	-
	
	  
	
	
	Keywords are reserved words that perform specific actions in HSL such as declaring variables and functions. It is forbidden to name anything else with the same name as the keyword, e.g. it is not possible to name a variable ‘abort’ within HSL.
	
	A list of keywords is shown in the table below:
	
	  
	
	
	
	
	| Keywords | | |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| abort | function | pragma |
	| break | global | private |
	| char | goto | quit |
	| const | if | return |
	| device | ifdef | resume |
	| debug | ifndef | sequence |
	| define | include | short |
	| dialog | lock | static |
	| echo | long | struct |
	| else | loop | string |
	| endif | method | synchronized |
	| error | namespace | timer |
	| exit | next | unlock |
	| event | object | variable |
	| file | once | void |
	| float | onerror | while |
	| for | pause | filename |
	5. ‌Operators‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Operators represent logical operations such as addition and subtraction. Operators can be used in variable calculations or in conditional processing (if, else statements) to compare data and make decisions. HSL has a full range of operators, including arithmetic, logical, bit\-wise, and assignment operators. Listed below are the different operators.
	
	
	
	| Symbol | Operator | Associativity |  | Symbol | Operator | Associativity |
	| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
	| ‖ | logical OR | Left | % | remainder | Left |
	| \&\& | logical AND | Left | \+ | add | Left |
	|  |  |  | \- | subtract | Left |
	| \| | bitwise OR | Left | \* | multiply | Left |
	| \& | bitwise AND | Left | / | divide | Left |
	| \< | less than | Left | ! | not | Right |
	| \<\= | less than or equal to | Left | ^ | power | Right |
	| \=\= | Equal | Left | \- | unary minus operator | Right |
	| !\= | not equal | Left | \+\+ | increment | Left |
	| \>\= | greater than or equal to | Left | \-\- | decrement | Left |
	| \> | greater than | Left | \= | assignment | Right |
	6. ‌Variables and Objects‌
	----
	
	  
	
	
	Variables are the basic components of a source code. They are used to store/represent information. A variable can be named according to preferences, except for a predefined HSL keyword or a function. It is possible to perform calculations with variables just like in the graphical Method Editor.
	
	There are different types of variables. The most common one only holds a value, e.g. a pipetting volume. But since variables are objects, these objects could also store other information more than just a value. A variable can also hold a sequence, a file, etc.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Variable Declaration‌
		
		  
		
		
		To declare a variable, use this code:
		
		
			* Variable myVariable;
			
			This will create a new variable named myVariable, and assigns zero (0\) as the default value to it. To initialize a variable with a specific value, use the following syntax:
			* Variable myVariable(5\); // Now, the variable holds the integer value 5
			* Variable myVariable(“**Hello**”); // this variable holds the string value Hello
			* Variable myVariable(hslTrue); // boolean declaration – true or falseVariables always need to be declared before being used at the start of the code block. They cannot be declared in the middle of the code.
		2. ### ‌Variable Scope‌
		
		  
		
		
		As stated previously, variables need to be declared at the beginning of a code block. These variables are local to that code block. In other words, they only exist in that section of code. There are a few other options however:
		
		
			* Global variables are declared at the beginning of a source file with the keyword ‘global’. These variables can be used all throughout the code – even in a different library or namespace.
			* Static variables are similar to a global variable but are global only to that certain library/namespace. They are declared using the keyword ‘static’.All other variables are local to the code block in which they are declared.
		3. ### ‌Array Declaration‌
		
		  
		
		
		Arrays are used to access a list of objects through the array name and the array index. An array can be of any sort of object (e.g. array of variables, array of files, array of sequences, etc…).
		
		To declare an array:
		
		
			1. Start by using the keyword of the type of the array (i.e. variable, file, sequence, etc…)
			2. Specify a name to it, just like a variable.
			3. Add a set of square brackets, \[ ] right after the name.
			4. An empty set of brackets creates an empty, undeclared length array.
			5. If a number is enclosed in brackets, \[5] it sets the size of the array.
			6. Unlike in the graphical Method Editor, arrays in HSL are zero based, not one based.
			
			A few examples:
			
			
				* Variable ArrayOfVariables\[ ]; // an empty array
				* Variable ArrayOfVariables\[100]; // an array with 100 elements
				* Sequence ArrayOfSequences\[ ]; // an empty array of sequences
		4. ### ‌If / Else Statements‌
		
		  
		
		
		HSL has the ability to compare things and make decisions. This is done with ‘If, Else’ statements. These are used in the exact same manner as they are in the graphical Method Editor, which should already be familiar.
		
		They can be nested within each other to check multiple conditions.
		
		They are more powerful than they are in the graphical Method Editor since multiple conditions at the same time can be checked. This eliminates the need for multiple nested ‘If, Else’ statements.
		
		‘If’ and ‘If, Else’ statements will look like shown below.
		
		If(var1 \=\= 2\)
		
		var2 \= 5;
		
		Else
		
		var2 \= 10;
		
		This example starts a new code block for multiple instructions If(var1 \=\= 2\)
		
		{
		
		var2 \= 5;
		
		var3 \= 10;
		
		}
		
		  
		
		
		Checking multiple conditions can also be as follows If(var1 \=\= 5 \&\& var2 \=\= 10\)
		
		{
		
		DoSomething();
		
		}
		
		Else
		
		{
		
		DoSomethingElse();
		
		}
		
		The above checks if both expressions are true. It is also possible to check other conditions such as ‘Or’ expressions. See the HSL Operators to know which operators can be used.
	7. ‌Loops‌
	-------
	
	  
	
	
	Just like in the graphical Method Editor, loops can be used in HSL to do certain things multiple times.
	
	There are 2 types of loops in HSL:
	
	‘for’ loops: These are used to do something a predetermined number of times.
	
	‘while’ loops: These are used to do something while an expression is true.
	
	The expression is similar to the ‘if, else’ statements.
	
	  
	
	
	There is also a ‘break’ command to break a loop when a certain condition is met.
	
	For loop statements look like this: for(i \= 0; i \<\= 100; i\+\+)
	
	{
	
	/\*…do something…\*/
	
	}
	
	The ‘i’ here is a loop variable.
	
	It is originally assigned a value. In this example it is declared with a 0 value.
	
	The second section of the *for* statement instructs the loop to keep going until i is greater than 100\. The last part of the statement increments the loop variable by 1 every time the loop is executed.
	
	While loops look like this: while(myVar \< 2000\)
	
	{
	
	/\*…do something…\*/
	
	}
	
	  
	
	
	The expression in the while loop is just like the expressions that are used in ‘If, Else’ statements. Usually the code block of the loop performs some action to change the result of the expression.
	8. ‌Functions‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	Functions are pieces of code that perform repetitive tasks. Functions are analogous to sub\- methods in graphical Method Editor files. Functions can (but don’t have to) accept variables and other objects as inputs. Similarly, functions can return a value of some sort (variable, sequence, file, etc.).
	
	A function call looks like the following:
	
	myFunction(); // This function does not return anything var1 \= myFunction(); // this function returns a variable
	
	var1 \= myFunction(5\); // this function returns a variable and has a variable as an input
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Function Declaration‌
		
		  
		
		
		A function declaration is just a statement allowing the compiler to know what functions are in existence. A function implementation is the actual code of the function. This tells the compiler how the function actually works.
		
		The declaration and implementation can be done at the same time but is usually split into separate parts. The declaration can be seen in the header file (.hsl) while the implementation can be seen in the source file (.hs\_).
		
		  
		
		
		A function declaration looks like this:
		
		function myFunction(variable var1\) variable
		
		  
		
		
		The parts of the declaration are as follows:
		
		function: This tells the compiler that this is a function.
		
		myFunction: This is the name of the function (however wanted).
		
		variable: This first one is telling the compiler that ‘myFunction’ takes in one variable called ‘var1’. There can be multiple type declarations here!
		
		variable: The second variable declaration is telling the compiler and the programmer that this function returns a variable type object.
		
		The variable declarations can be replaced with any type of object, e.g. sequence, file, etc….
		
		A function does not have to return a variable. Some functions return other objects such as sequences or files while other functions can return nothing at all (this is marked by the keyword void). Sometimes an “**\&**” can be seen after the word variable in the list of passed in variables/objects:
		
		function myFunction(variable\& var1\) void
		
		This ampersand is telling the compiler that the variable that is passed in is also passed out with a value that has potentially changed. This is called passing a variable by reference.
		
		If there is no ampersand then the variable that is passed in is not changed by the function.
	9. ‌Namespaces‌
	---
	
	  
	
	
	A namespace is a way to protect the functions of the library/sourcecode. This is a way to distinguish where a function comes from. For instance, when using 2 libraries and they both contain a function called ‘Init’, the compiler would not be able to distinguish between the 2 and would produce an error. If a namespace is used for each library, the compiler gets information about the origin of the function.
	
	Namespaces are declared using the ‘namespace’ keyword.
	
	All the code belonging to the namespace has to be enclosed by opening and closing curly brackets.
	10. ‌Using Libraries in HSL‌
	-----
	
	  
	
	
	Just like in the graphical Method Editor, other HSL libraries can be used in the code in order to access all of the functions that have already been created. Libraries are always included at the beginning of the source file. The preprocessor is used to include these files.
	
	The preprocessor is a ‘macro’ that runs before the source code is compiled. This allows the compiler to get instructions on what is needed for the code to compile correctly.
	
	  
	
	
	
		1. ### ‌Preprocessor Syntax‌
		
		  
		
		
		Preprocessor commands are always prefixed with a ‘\#’ sign.
		
		These are usually seen at the beginning of an HSL file but also sometimes at the end. Typically in HSL 2 types of preprocessor commands can be seen:
		
		Include commands. These are used to tell the compiler that some features from another HSL file (library) are used.
		
		Include commands look like this: \#include “**HSLMthLib.hsl**”
		
		Inclusion guards. These are used to tell the compiler to check whether a particular library is already included through some other bit of source code. This is important because trying to include the same library more than once will cause an error.
		
		Inclusion guards look like this: \#ifndef   HSLMthLib\_hsl  
		
		\#define   HSLMthLib\_hsl    1
		
		/\* ….
		
		…. hsl code which implements the MthLib
		
		…. \*/ \#endif
		2. ### ‌HSL Runtime Inclusion Guard‌
		
		  
		
		
		In every library there is a special inclusion guard that looks like the following:
		
		
			* \#ifndef HSL\_RUNTIME
			* code here
			* \#endif
			* \#ifdef HSL\_RUNTIME
			* code here
			* \#endifThis is an inclusion guard that is checking to see if it is programming in VENUS or if the run engine is running. The library header will be presented in the ‘\#ifndef’ section and the implementation will be presented in the ‘\#ifdef’ section. It is located in these sections so that the actual commands are not compiled while programming in VENUS. This makes the editor tools faster.
		3. ### ‌Add Bitmaps‌
		
		  
		
		
		Adding those little icons to the library commands (seen while programming in VENUS) is easy. First, draw or download a bitmap image. The dimensions need to be either 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 pixels. Save the bitmap image with the same name as the library in the library directory. VENUS will do the rest of the steps and automatically load the icon when the library is included.
		
		To create a separate picture for a particular function, save the bitmap image with the library name and the function name separated with a period (*libraryname.functionname.bmp*).
	11. ‌Add a Help File‌
	--------
	
	  
	
	
	Adding a help file for the library is just as easy as adding an icon. VENUS Help Files are CHM or HLP file structures. Only an appropriate editor is needed to create CHM or HLP files. A number of free editors can be found on the web.
	
	Either create a file using an editor or write it in word and then use the CHM Editor to translate it. Save the help file with the same name as the library in the library folder just like bitmaps. It is highly recommended to create help files for a library. No one else will be able to support it otherwise.
	12. ‌VENUS Help Function‌
	--
	
	  
	
	
	To get more information about the HSL Editor, refer to the VENUS Help Function:
	
	  
	
	
	<img src\=".gitbook/assets/image (1864\).jpg" alt\="image" data\-size\="original" width\="409" height\="107">
	
	It is located in the “Help Menu  Help Topics” and provides fundamental information in three categories:
	
	
		* HSL Method overview / Keyboard shortcuts / Modifying a method
		* All available menu options (File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Window, Help)
		* An HSL reference guide to cover all aspects of HSL programming
12. ‌3rd Party Equipment‌


There is a wide range of ML STAR integrated devices for many applications to choose from.

The commands for these devices are functions of the additional libraries. These libraries are not part of the basic software package and need to be ordered in addition.

In order to make the library functions available, install the library into the folder

“**…\\Hamilton\\Library**”.

To make the commands available, there is a need to link the library to the method. Add the “\*.hsl” Library File to the method through the "Method  Libraries...[" Menu (refer to](#bookmark314) Section 11\.12 UsingLibraries).

For software drivers, please consult a local Hamilton Representative. 3rd party equipment which can be integrated includes, but is not limited to the following:


	* Readers (plate readers for fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, time\-resolved fluorescence, luminescence, UV/VIS absorbance)
	* Plate Washers
	* Heaters / Shakers
	* Centrifuges
	* Incubators and Plate Hotels
	* Thermocyclers
	* Plate sealers
	* Sample Drying Stations

| Pause | Interruption of processing. The current processing steps are completed. |
| Pipetting | Transfer of liquids from one container to another. |
| Pipetting Arm | Assembly equipped with the pipetting device and/or plate handler. |
| Pipetting Channel | Hardware including the function of picking up a tip aspirating, dispensing, tip eject, Liquid Level Detection and the Y/Z\- movements |
| Pooling | Pipetting of different liquids in one well; 1, 2, 3…to n and n to 1, 2, 3\... |
| Processing Step | Defines what must be carried out on the ML STAR instrument, as well as the location it must be carried out and possible interaction with other system components or labware. The action is defined in accordance with the methods, the loading and the tasks. |
| Rack | Group of containers, as DWP, MTP, etc. |
| Rack Identification | Barcode for rack identification |
| Random Access | Means that every pipetting channel can access any position anywhere on the work area. |
| Run | Execution of the processing steps defined in the method with the aim of processing one or more liquids and containers (e.g. MTP). The run is a series of timed commands, in order to carry out processing on the ML STAR according to the processing plan. |
| Run Abort | Cancelled run by the user or by the ML STAR |
| Run Visualization | Visualization of the current run, reporting the status of the ML STAR. |
| Sample | Refers to a liquid in a unique identified container which is to be processed. |
| Sequence | A list that specifies the order of execution for an action on the ML STAR instrument. Generally, two sequences are required: Asource\- and a target sequence (e.g., for pipetting from a source to a target sequence). |
| Stacker | Storage unit for racks |
| Side Touch | Pipetting on the wall of a container of its center to prevent droplets. |
| TADM | Total Aspiration and Dispensing Monitoring. The pressure inside each individual pipetting channel is monitored, during aspiration and dispensing. |
| Tip | Disposable tip for pipetting |



| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Tip Rack | Frame that holds the tips. |
| Tip Waste | Container for ejected tips. |
| Touch\-Off | Type of dispensing where the tip approaches the bottom of the empty container so close as to allow the dispensed droplet to have simultaneous contact with the tip and the container bottom. |
| Trace | Record of the status during processing |
| Tube | A container for liquid, usually having a circular cross\-section, and a cylindrical length section. |
| User | User of the software. Access rights for different types of users can be defined, such as operators, laboratory manager, etc. |
| Waste Container | A device on the ML STAR deck to collect used disposable tips. |
| Well | The individual container of a MTP or DWP. |
| Well Type | Geometrical shape of the well, such as U, V or flat. |
| Wick Side of Container | Type of dispensing where tip touches the side of the container and thus releases the droplet. This function is not available for theML STAR instruments. |
| Work Area | The area of the ML STAR to which access is provided during the processing. Elements to be pipetted or handled can be placed in this area. |
| Worklist | Information according to which a method is to be executed on the ML STAR. A worklist may contain different parameters e.g.Pipetting volume, heating temperature, shaking speed, etc. |
